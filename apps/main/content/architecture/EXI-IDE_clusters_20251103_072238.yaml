    scope: Encompasses life story construction, narrative coherence, temporal self-continuity, redemptive and contamination sequences, narrative complexity, and story reconstruction in recovery. Includes analysis of key scenes, recurring themes, narrative tone, and imagined futures. Focuses specifically on the storied nature of identity rather than authentic expression or self-concept clarity.
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster narrows the parent field's focus to the narrative dimension of identity, examining how individuals construct coherent life stories that provide unity and purpose across time, particularly in recovery contexts.
    polarity_dimension: The coherence and redemptive quality of life narrative - ranging from purposeful coherent narratives with growth themes to directionless fragmented narratives with contamination sequences.
    emergence: At the cluster level, narrative identity exhibits emergent temporal integration that links past, present, and future self into meaningful continuity. This creates narrative meaning from disparate life events, redemptive transformation of suffering, and prospective life purpose that guides recovery trajectory.
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Narrative-authenticity interface where stories must feel genuinely self-authored
      - Narrative-integration interface where coherent narrative brings together fragmented self-aspects
      - Narrative-concept interface where life story shapes self-understanding
    child_generation_role: You are a narrative identity researcher specializing in life story construction and narrative coherence in addiction recovery. Your expertise includes analyzing narrative structure, redemptive sequences, contamination sequences, and narrative tone. You examine key scenes (high points, low points, turning points), recurring themes, imagined endings, and narrative complexity. You distinguish between purposeful narratives showing coherence, agency, redemption, and growth versus directionless narratives showing fragmentation, contamination, stagnation, and repetitive cycles. You ground analysis in McAdams' life story model and narrative therapy frameworks.
    academic_description: Narrative identity represents the internalized and evolving life story that individuals construct to provide their lives with unity, purpose, and meaning. McAdams conceptualizes identity as a narrative construction beginning in late adolescence, incorporating reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. In addiction contexts, narrative disruption occurs through contamination sequences where positive events lead to negative outcomes, creating pessimistic narrative tone. Recovery involves narrative reconstruction, developing redemptive sequences where suffering leads to growth. Research demonstrates that narrative coherence, thematic agency, and redemptive processing predict recovery outcomes. White & Epston's narrative therapy externalizes problems, identifies unique outcomes, and supports preferred identity story development.
    clinical_description: Clinical work with narrative identity helps clients reconstruct life stories from fragmented addiction narratives to coherent recovery narratives. Assessment explores current life story through questions about chapters, key scenes, significant characters, and imagined endings. Therapists identify contamination sequences where addiction disrupted positive trajectories and help develop redemptive reframes. Life review exercises examine turning points, exploring how past experiences shaped current identity. Clients author new chapters for recovery, imagining future scenes aligned with preferred identity. Narrative therapy techniques externalize addiction as antagonist in life story rather than identity definition. Treatment addresses narrative rumination through story completion, helping clients move from repetitive problem-saturated stories to progressive narratives with movement and development.
    lay_description: Your life story is how you make sense of who you are by connecting your past, present, and imagined future into a meaningful narrative. In addiction, this story often becomes broken and confused - you might feel like your life doesn't make sense anymore, or that every good thing led to something bad. Recovery involves putting your story back together in a new way. This means looking at your life chapters, identifying turning points, and understanding how you got here. You learn to see addiction as something that happened to you rather than who you are. You can rewrite your story to show growth from struggles rather than being defeated by them. The goal is creating a coherent life story where your past makes sense, your present has purpose, and your future holds possibility.

    synonyms:
      - Genuine self

      - Authenticity
      - Real self
      - Authentic functioning
    scope: Encompasses genuine versus false self-presentation, congruence between inner experience and outer expression, authentic relating, and dismantling defensive facades. Includes self-awareness, unbiased self-processing, behavioral authenticity, and relational orientation. Focuses on the genuineness dimension rather than narrative structure or identity integration.
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster specifies the parent field's authenticity dimension, examining how individuals develop and express their genuine self versus maintaining false self patterns, particularly in recovery from addiction.
    polarity_dimension: The genuineness of self-expression - ranging from purposeful authentic functioning with congruent expression to directionless false self patterns with defensive masking and disconnection.
    emergence: At the cluster level, authentic self-expression creates emergent authentic presence that enables genuine connection with others. This includes embodied authenticity felt as somatic congruence, relational depth from genuine engagement, and self-trust developing from consistent authentic expression.
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Authenticity-narrative interface where life stories must feel genuinely self-authored
      - Authenticity-integration interface where authentic expression requires integrated self
      - Authenticity-concept interface where self-understanding guides genuine expression
    child_generation_role: You are an authenticity researcher specializing in genuine self-expression and false self patterns in addiction recovery. Your expertise includes analyzing self-awareness, unbiased self-processing, behavioral authenticity, and relational orientation. You examine defensive facades, people-pleasing patterns, authentic needs recognition, and genuine emotional expression. You distinguish between purposeful authentic functioning showing self-awareness, congruence, and genuine relating versus directionless false self patterns showing disconnection, pretense, and defensive masking. You ground analysis in Kernis & Goldman's authenticity framework and Winnicott's true/false self theory.
    academic_description: "Authentic self-expression involves the unobstructed operation of one's true or core self in daily functioning. Kernis & Goldman's multicomponent model identifies four aspects: awareness (knowing one's internal states), unbiased processing (objective self-evaluation), behavior (acting consistently with values and needs), and relational orientation (genuine relating). Winnicott's true/false self theory describes how individuals develop compliant facades to manage environmental demands, particularly relevant in addiction where false self patterns manage shame and maintain use. Research shows authenticity correlates with well-being, self-esteem, and reduced substance use. The false self in addiction involves impression management, emotional suppression, and disconnection from genuine needs. Recovery requires dismantling defensive facades and tolerating vulnerability of authentic expression."
    clinical_description: Clinical work with authenticity helps clients recognize and express their genuine self beneath addiction's false self patterns. Assessment explores authenticity through questions about when clients feel most/least themselves, what they hide from others, and where they feel pressure to be different. Therapists identify false self patterns like people-pleasing, emotional masking, and performative behaviors developed to manage addiction. Treatment involves authenticity experiments - small steps of genuine expression in safe contexts. Clients practice identifying authentic feelings versus defensive reactions, expressing genuine needs despite vulnerability, and tolerating others' responses to their real self. Work addresses authenticity fears including rejection, inadequacy exposure, and loss of control. The therapeutic relationship models authentic relating through genuine presence and congruent communication.
    lay_description: Being authentic means being your real self rather than putting on an act or wearing a mask. In addiction, you might have developed a "false self" - pretending everything's fine, hiding your true feelings, or being who others want you to be. You might not even know who you really are anymore beneath all the pretending. Recovery involves discovering and expressing your genuine self, even when it feels scary or vulnerable. This means recognizing when you're being fake versus real, understanding what you truly feel and need, and gradually showing more of your authentic self to others. It's about dropping the masks and facades, being honest about your struggles, and connecting with others as your real self rather than who you think you should be.

    scope: Encompasses integration of fragmented self-aspects, resolution of identity conflicts, harmonization of disparate roles, and development of coherent identity structure. Includes parts work, shadow integration, role synthesis, and unified self-emergence. Focuses on the integration process rather than narrative construction or authentic expression.
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster narrows the parent field to focus on identity integration processes, examining how individuals resolve fragmentation and develop coherent, unified identity structure in recovery.
    polarity_dimension: The integration level of identity structure - ranging from purposeful integrated identity with internal coherence to directionless fragmented identity with conflicting parts and dissociation.
    emergence: At the cluster level, identity integration produces emergent internal harmony where previously conflicting parts work together. This creates stable yet flexible self-structure, reduced internal sabotage, and capacity for complex self-expression that honors all aspects of self.
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Integration-narrative interface where coherent narrative emerges from integrated parts
      - Integration-authenticity interface where integration enables genuine expression
      - Integration-concept interface where integration clarifies core self-understanding
    child_generation_role: You are an identity integration specialist focusing on resolving fragmented self-aspects and identity conflicts in addiction recovery. Your expertise includes analyzing identity structure, self-aspect differentiation, internal conflicts, and integration processes. You examine identity compartmentalization, conflicting roles, shadow aspects, and unified self-emergence. You distinguish between purposeful integrated identity showing internal coherence, flexible stability, and harmonized self-aspects versus directionless fragmented identity showing internal conflict, rigid splitting, and dissociated parts. You ground analysis in Breakwell's Identity Process Theory and dialogical self frameworks.
    academic_description: Identity integration involves synthesizing fragmented self-aspects into coherent identity structure. Breakwell's Identity Process Theory describes how individuals assimilate new experiences and accommodate identity changes while maintaining continuity. Hermans' dialogical self theory conceptualizes identity as multiplicity of I-positions in internal dialogue. In addiction, identity becomes fragmented through compartmentalization (separating using self from other roles), splitting (all-good/all-bad self-states), and dissociation (disconnecting from shameful aspects). Recovery requires integration through recognizing disowned parts, resolving internal conflicts, and developing inclusive identity that honors all self-aspects. Research shows identity integration predicts reduced internal conflict, improved self-regulation, and sustained recovery. Integration occurs through dialogue between parts, finding common ground, and developing superordinate identity that encompasses previously conflicting aspects.
    clinical_description: Clinical work with identity integration helps clients recognize and harmonize fragmented self-aspects into coherent identity. Assessment explores internal multiplicity through identifying different "parts" or "voices" - the addict, the parent, the professional, the child. Therapists map internal conflicts between parts that want recovery versus those attached to use. Treatment uses parts work, having clients dialogue between conflicting aspects to understand each part's positive intention. Internal Family Systems approaches help clients develop Self-leadership over reactive parts. Identity mapping exercises explore how different roles and self-aspects can coexist. Clients practice "both/and" thinking rather than "either/or" splitting. Work addresses the "addict identity" as one part rather than total self, integrating its protective function while developing healthier strategies. The goal is internal harmony where all parts work together toward recovery.
    lay_description: You might feel like you have different parts of yourself that don't fit together - the part that wants recovery, the part that misses using, the responsible parent, the rebellious teenager inside. These parts might fight with each other, making you feel torn or confused about who you really are. Identity integration means bringing these different parts together into one whole person. Instead of being either an addict or a person in recovery, you become someone who has struggled with addiction as part of your larger story. This involves recognizing all your different sides, understanding what each part needs, and finding ways for them to work together rather than against each other. It's like being the conductor of an orchestra, helping all your different instruments play in harmony rather than creating noise.

    scope: Encompasses development of clear self-understanding, identity formation processes, self-concept clarity, and stable self-definition. Includes identity exploration, commitment, core beliefs about self, and possible selves development. Focuses on the clarity and stability of self-concept rather than narrative, authenticity, or integration dimensions.
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster specifies the parent field's self-concept dimension, examining how individuals develop clear, stable understanding of who they are, particularly through identity reconstruction in recovery.
    polarity_dimension: The clarity and commitment of self-concept - ranging from purposeful clear self-concept with defined identity to directionless confused self-concept with identity diffusion.
    emergence: At the cluster level, self-concept development creates emergent identity capital that provides resources for navigating life challenges. This includes decision-making framework from clear values and priorities, behavioral consistency from stable self-definition, and resilience from secure identity foundation.

      - Concept-narrative interface where self-understanding shapes life story construction
      - Concept-authenticity interface where clear self-concept guides genuine expression
      - Concept-integration interface where development leads to integrated understanding
    child_generation_role: You are a self-concept researcher specializing in identity formation and self-understanding development in addiction recovery. Your expertise includes analyzing self-concept clarity, identity commitment, identity exploration, and self-definition processes. You examine core self-beliefs, identity confusion, self-discovery processes, and stable self-understanding emergence. You distinguish between purposeful clear self-concept showing defined boundaries, consistent self-knowledge, and identity commitment versus directionless confused self-concept showing identity diffusion, unstable self-definition, and chronic uncertainty. You ground analysis in Campbell's self-concept clarity framework and Marcia's identity status theory.
    academic_description: Self-concept development involves forming clear, confident understanding of one's attributes, beliefs, and goals. Campbell's self-concept clarity refers to the extent to which self-beliefs are clearly defined, internally consistent, and temporally stable. Marcia's identity status theory describes four statuses, achievement (exploration leading to commitment), moratorium (active exploration), foreclosure (commitment without exploration), and diffusion (neither exploration nor commitment). In addiction, self-concept becomes unclear through identity confusion, unstable self-definition, and erosion of core self-knowledge. Recovery involves identity reconstruction through exploration of values, interests, and goals beyond substance use. Possible selves theory (Markus & Nurius) examines hoped-for and feared future selves that motivate change. Research shows self-concept clarity predicts well-being, decision-making quality, and recovery maintenance.
    clinical_description: Clinical work with self-concept development helps clients develop clear, stable understanding of who they are beyond addiction. Assessment explores self-concept clarity through questions about core qualities, values, and life direction. Therapists identify areas of identity confusion, exploring questions like "Who am I without substances?" "What defines me?" "What do I stand for?" Treatment involves structured identity exploration through values clarification, strengths identification, and interest exploration. Clients complete self-concept mapping exercises, creating visual representations of their multifaceted identity. Work addresses identity foreclosure where clients prematurely adopt "addict" or "recovery" identity without exploration. Possible selves exercises help clients envision hoped-for future selves and identify feared selves to avoid. The approach emphasizes that recovery involves not just stopping use but discovering who you are and who you want to become.
    lay_description: Knowing who you are means having a clear, stable sense of your identity - your values, strengths, interests, and what makes you uniquely you. Addiction often creates identity confusion where you lose track of who you are, what you care about, or what defines you beyond substance use. You might wonder "Who am I without drugs or alcohol?" or feel like you don't know yourself anymore. Recovery involves rediscovering or sometimes discovering for the first time who you really are. This means exploring your values and what matters most to you, identifying your strengths and natural abilities, and figuring out your interests and passions. It's about developing a clear sense of self that goes beyond just being "an addict" or "in recovery" - understanding yourself as a complete person with many different qualities and possibilities.
