  scope: Represents secure trust and faith in the sacred, characterized by confidence in divine benevolence, ability to rely on higher power for support, peace in uncertainty, and spiritual security that allows vulnerability and dependence on the transcendent.
  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the trust dimension of sacred connection, focusing on the foundational faith and confidence that enables relational engagement with the transcendent.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as purposeful spiritual trust with confidence in divine care, ability to rely on sacred support, and faith that sustains through challenges.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with secure attachment (psy-att-sec) in psychological bonding, cohesive support (soc-sup-coh) in social trust, and regulated stress (phy-str-reg) through faith-based calming.
  academic_description: Research on attachment to God shows secure divine attachment predicts better mental health, recovery outcomes, and spiritual wellbeing. Pargament's studies demonstrate that positive God concepts and benevolent religious reappraisals facilitate coping and growth. Trust in the sacred activates similar neural circuits as secure human attachment, suggesting shared mechanisms for transcendent and interpersonal trust. Faith development theory describes movement from external authority-based faith through questioning to mature trust grounded in experience and relationship.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores God concepts, faith history, and trust capacity through spiritual genograms and belief inventories. Treatment addresses trust barriers including spiritual trauma, divine disappointment, and theological confusion. Interventions include exploring evidence of divine care in personal history, reframing God concepts, and gradual trust experiments. Common issues include anger at God for allowing addiction, difficulty trusting after religious betrayal, and fear of divine punishment. Building sacred trust often requires processing spiritual wounds while developing new experiences of divine benevolence.
  lay_description: Sacred trust means having faith that there's something greater than yourself that cares about you and wants your wellbeing. It's being able to rely on your higher power for strength and guidance, knowing you're not alone even in your darkest moments. This trust lets you feel spiritually secure—like a child who knows their parent will catch them if they fall. In recovery, developing this trust helps you believe that your higher power can do for you what you cannot do for yourself, providing a foundation for letting go of the need to control everything.

  scope: Represents spiritual mistrust and cynicism toward the sacred, characterized by inability to rely on higher power, fear of divine abandonment or punishment, spiritual cynicism from perceived betrayals, and exclusive self-reliance that blocks transcendent support.
  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the trust breakdown in sacred connection, focusing on the mistrust and cynicism that prevents relational engagement with the transcendent.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as directionless spiritual mistrust with cynicism about divine care, inability to rely on sacred support, and wounded faith that blocks connection.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with insecure attachment (psy-att-ins) in relational wounding, fragmented support (soc-sup-fra) in social mistrust, and dysregulated stress (phy-str-dys) through loss of faith-based coping.
  academic_description: Research shows spiritual struggles and negative God concepts predict worse mental health and recovery outcomes. Studies of spiritual trauma reveal how religious betrayal, toxic theology, and divine disappointment create lasting trust wounds. Exline's work on anger at God demonstrates how unresolved divine conflict maintains addiction and blocks spiritual resources. Neuroimaging shows spiritual mistrust activates threat detection circuits similar to interpersonal betrayal, suggesting shared mechanisms for processing sacred and human trust violations.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores spiritual trauma history, negative God concepts, and trust barriers through careful spiritual assessment. Treatment requires gentle exploration of spiritual wounds without forcing faith. Interventions include processing anger at God, examining toxic religious messages, and differentiating human religious failures from the sacred itself. Common presentations include rage at God for allowing trauma, terror of divine punishment, and cynicism from religious hypocrisy. Healing requires validating spiritual pain while slowly exploring possibilities for renewed sacred connection.
  lay_description: Spiritual mistrust is when you can't believe in or rely on any higher power because you've been hurt, disappointed, or betrayed in that area. Maybe you prayed desperately and nothing changed, or religious people harmed you, or you feel God abandoned you to your addiction. This leaves you trying to be your own god, unable to trust anything beyond yourself for help. The cynicism and hurt create a wall between you and any spiritual resources, keeping you trapped in self-reliance even when it's clearly not working.
  foundational_themes: Divine abandonment, sacred betrayal, ultimate aloneness, cosmic indifference
  experiential_processes: Experiencing unanswered prayer, feeling divinely punished, perceiving sacred absence, confirming spiritual cynicism

  synonyms:
  - Spiritual release
  - Divine surrender
  - Sacred letting go
  - Transcendent yielding
  scope: Represents willing surrender to the sacred, characterized by release of ego control, acceptance of divine guidance, turning will and life over to higher power's care, and spiritual humility that acknowledges human limitation and transcendent wisdom.
  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the surrender dimension of sacred connection, focusing on the release of self-will that enables divine guidance and transformation.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as purposeful spiritual surrender with willing release of control, acceptance of divine will, and humble yielding to transcendent wisdom.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with adaptive ego functioning (psy-ego-ada) in healthy self-transcendence, cohesive autonomy (soc-aut-coh) in interdependence, and regulated autonomic response (phy-ans-reg) in physiological letting go.
  academic_description: Research on spiritual surrender shows it predicts better recovery outcomes and psychological wellbeing when coupled with active responsibility. Pargament's studies distinguish positive religious surrender (trusting release to benevolent God) from passive resignation. The 12-step literature emphasizes surrender as gateway to transformation, with Step 3 ('Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over') marking crucial transition. Neuroscience reveals surrender states involve decreased activity in control-related prefrontal regions and increased activity in trust and reward circuits.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores control patterns, surrender capacity, and willingness to release outcomes. Treatment addresses surrender barriers including control addiction, trust deficits, and misconceptions about surrender as weakness. Interventions include Step 3 work, surrender meditation, and practicing 'turning it over.' Common issues include confusing surrender with resignation, fear of losing self, and difficulty distinguishing what to control versus release. Effective surrender requires maintaining personal responsibility while releasing ultimate control, acting with wisdom while accepting outcomes.
  lay_description: Willing surrender means letting go of the exhausting need to control everything and trusting your higher power to guide your life. It's like finally putting down a weight you've been carrying for years—admitting you can't manage everything yourself and that's actually okay. This isn't giving up or being passive; it's actively choosing to follow divine guidance rather than your own willpower. In recovery, surrender often starts with admitting powerlessness over addiction and grows into a daily practice of turning over worries, outcomes, and decisions to your higher power's care.
  foundational_themes: Divine wisdom, human limitation, transcendent guidance, sacred trust in outcomes
  experiential_processes: Releasing control, accepting powerlessness, following guidance, trusting divine will

  synonyms:
  - Spiritual control
  - Playing God
  - Divine resistance
  - Sacred defiance
  scope: Represents rigid self-will and control, characterized by inability to surrender, insistence on personal control, resistance to divine guidance, and spiritual pride that maintains ego inflation and blocks transcendent wisdom.
  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the surrender resistance in sacred connection, focusing on the self-will that prevents divine guidance and maintains ego control.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as directionless self-will with compulsive control, rejection of divine guidance, and prideful insistence on personal power.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with maladaptive ego defenses (psy-ego-mal) in rigid control, fragmented autonomy (soc-aut-fra) in isolation, and dysregulated autonomic response (phy-ans-dys) in chronic tension.
  academic_description: Research identifies 'self-will run riot' as core addiction dynamic, with control addiction maintaining substance use despite consequences. Studies show those unable to surrender have worse recovery outcomes and higher relapse rates. The phenomenon of 'playing God' involves ego inflation where individuals attempt to control uncontrollable outcomes, creating suffering through attachment to personal will. Neuroscience reveals chronic control states involve overactive prefrontal control circuits and suppressed trust networks.
  clinical_description: Assessment examines control patterns, consequences of self-will, and fears underlying control needs. Treatment addresses the illusion of control and costs of maintaining it. Interventions include powerlessness inventories, exploring control consequences, and gradual release experiments. Common presentations include inability to accept help, chronic self-reliance despite failure, and treating surrender as defeat. Key is helping clients see self-will as prison rather than power, recognizing how control addiction maintains other addictions.
  lay_description: Rigid self-will is when you insist on being your own god, trying to control everything through sheer willpower even when it's clearly not working. It's the voice that says 'I've got this' even as your life falls apart, refusing help because admitting need feels like failure. This isn't strength—it's exhausting resistance that keeps you trapped in patterns you can't break alone. In addiction, self-will tells you that you can control your use, quit anytime, or manage life without help, maintaining the very prison you're trying to escape.
  foundational_themes: Ego inflation, ultimate self-reliance, divine defiance, cosmic control
  experiential_processes: Maintaining control, resisting guidance, asserting will, defending ego position

  polarity_expression: Manifests as purposeful divine presence with felt sacred nearness, spiritual companionship, and transcendent awareness that provides comfort.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with adaptive object relations (psy-obj-ada) in internalized presence, cohesive belonging (soc-bel-coh) in spiritual community, and regulated attachment systems (phy-att-reg) in felt security.
  academic_description: Research on divine presence shows it buffers stress, reduces existential isolation, and predicts better mental health outcomes. Studies of mystical experience identify 'unitive consciousness' and 'sacred presence' as core features correlating with lasting positive change. The attachment to God literature demonstrates that felt divine presence functions as spiritual secure base, providing comfort in distress. Neuroscience reveals presence experiences activate social bonding and attachment circuits, suggesting sacred presence engages interpersonal connection systems.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores capacity to sense divine presence, barriers to awareness, and quality of felt companionship. Treatment cultivates presence awareness through contemplative practices and sacred mindfulness. Interventions include presence meditation, practicing Brother Lawrence's 'presence of God,' and Ignatian awareness exercises. Common issues include inability to feel presence despite belief, confusing presence with emotion, and fear of divine nearness. Key is helping clients recognize subtle presence markers and develop receptivity to sacred companionship.
  lay_description: Divine presence is the felt sense that you're not alone—that something sacred is with you, aware of you, and available to you. It's like feeling held by something infinitely larger and more loving than yourself, especially in your darkest moments. This isn't necessarily a dramatic experience; often it's a quiet knowing, a subtle comfort, or a sense of being accompanied through difficulty. In recovery, feeling divine presence transforms isolation into companionship, providing strength and comfort that no human relationship can fully offer.
  foundational_themes: Sacred nearness, divine accompaniment, transcendent availability, ultimate companionship
  experiential_processes: Sensing sacred presence, feeling accompanied, experiencing divine nearness, recognizing spiritual companionship

  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the presence breakdown in sacred connection, focusing on the felt absence and abandonment that creates spiritual desolation.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as directionless spiritual abandonment with felt divine absence, cosmic aloneness, and desolation that intensifies isolation.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with maladaptive object relations (psy-obj-mal) in abandonment fears, fragmented belonging (soc-bel-fra) in social isolation, and dysregulated attachment (phy-att-dys) in separation distress.
  academic_description: Research on spiritual struggles identifies divine abandonment as particularly distressing, predicting depression, anxiety, and suicidality. The 'dark night of the soul' literature describes periods of felt divine absence as potential growth catalyst or devastating crisis. Studies show perceived divine abandonment during trauma creates lasting spiritual wounds affecting recovery capacity. Neuroscience reveals abandonment experiences activate similar circuits as interpersonal rejection, intensifying pain through transcendent dimension.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores abandonment experiences, divine absence, and spiritual desolation through careful inquiry. Treatment requires holding space for spiritual pain without quick fixes or platitudes. Interventions include validating desolation, exploring abandonment meanings, and gentle presence practices. Common presentations include feeling God has withdrawn, cosmic aloneness despite belief, and terror of ultimate abandonment. Key is normalizing spiritual dryness while addressing clinical depression and supporting gradual reconnection.
  lay_description: Spiritual abandonment feels like being utterly alone in the universe—as if God or your higher power has turned away, leaving you in a cosmic void. It's the devastating sense that you've been forgotten or rejected by whatever you once found sacred. This isn't just loneliness; it's existential desolation that makes you feel like you're screaming into an empty universe that doesn't care. In addiction, this abandonment often feels like proof that you're beyond redemption, unworthy of divine love or help.

  academic_description: Research on mystical experience identifies unitive consciousness and divine love as transformative features predicting lasting positive change. The spiritual intimacy literature shows correlation with secure attachment, emotional regulation, and identity integration. Studies of contemplative practice demonstrate that divine intimacy experiences involve similar neural activation as human intimacy, including oxytocin and dopamine release. The mystical theology tradition describes progression from purgation through illumination to union, mapping deepening divine intimacy.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores capacity for spiritual intimacy, barriers to divine closeness, and quality of sacred relationship. Treatment facilitates deepening intimacy through contemplative practices and addressing intimacy fears. Interventions include centering prayer, divine love meditation, and lectio divina for intimate encounter. Common issues include fear of divine intimacy, confusion between spiritual and sexual intimacy, and difficulty receiving divine love. Key is creating safe space for vulnerable sacred encounter while respecting individual pace and style.
  lay_description: Spiritual intimacy is the experience of being deeply close to your higher power—sharing your innermost self and feeling profoundly known and loved in return. It's like the warmth of being held by infinite love, where all masks fall away and you're accepted exactly as you are. These moments of sacred closeness might come in prayer, meditation, or unexpected grace, leaving you transformed by the experience of ultimate love. In recovery, this intimacy heals the deepest wounds, showing you that you're worthy of divine love despite everything you've done.

  polarity_expression: Manifests as directionless spiritual distance with sacred coldness, divine remoteness, and inability to experience transformative intimacy.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with avoidant attachment (psy-att-avo) in intimacy fears, fragmented intimacy (soc-int-fra) in relational distance, and dysregulated oxytocin (phy-oxy-dys) in bonding deficits.
  academic_description: Research shows avoidant attachment to God correlates with emotional suppression, difficulty receiving support, and maintaining addiction patterns. Studies identify 'distant God representations' as risk factor for depression and existential isolation. The phenomenon of 'functional deism'—believing in God but experiencing no relational closeness—predicts spiritual dryness and reduced wellbeing. Neuroscience reveals avoidant spiritual patterns involve suppressed attachment and reward circuits similar to interpersonal avoidance.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores barriers to divine intimacy, distant God concepts, and fears of sacred closeness. Treatment gently addresses intimacy avoidance while respecting defenses. Interventions include exploring intimacy fears, warming God images, and graduated closeness exercises. Common issues include intellectual belief without felt connection, fear that closeness means loss of self, and confusion about divine intimacy. Key is recognizing distance as protection while slowly exploring possibilities for safe sacred closeness.
  lay_description: Spiritual distance is when your relationship with your higher power feels cold, formal, or remote—like believing in God but feeling no warmth or closeness. It's going through spiritual motions without feeling spiritually touched, praying to a distant deity who seems uninvolved in your life. This creates a peculiar loneliness—believing you're not alone while feeling utterly disconnected from divine love. In recovery, this distance keeps you from experiencing the transformative power of being truly loved by something greater than yourself.

  academic_description: Research on prayer and meditation shows regular spiritual practice predicts better recovery outcomes, emotional regulation, and life satisfaction. The 11th step literature emphasizes 'sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact,' with studies showing this practice correlates with sustained sobriety. Contemplative neuroscience reveals regular spiritual practice strengthens prefrontal-limbic connectivity and default mode network coherence. Studies demonstrate bidirectional prayer (talking and listening) provides superior benefits to petitionary prayer alone.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores current spiritual practices, communication patterns, and receptivity to guidance. Treatment develops sustainable conscious contact through varied practices matching individual style. Interventions include 11th step work, prayer development, meditation training, and spiritual direction. Common issues include mechanical prayer without connection, difficulty listening for guidance, and inconsistent practice. Key is finding authentic communication style—some connect through formal prayer, others through nature meditation, still others through contemplative reading or sacred music.
  lay_description: Conscious contact means maintaining an ongoing conversation with your higher power through prayer, meditation, or whatever practices help you connect. It's not just talking at God when you're desperate, but developing a real two-way relationship—speaking your truth and listening for guidance. This might be morning meditation, throughout-the-day check-ins, or evening gratitude prayers. In recovery, conscious contact becomes your lifeline, providing daily guidance, strength when tempted, and reminders that you're not doing this alone.

  parent_scope_inheritance: This anchor specifies the contact breakdown in sacred connection, focusing on the silence and disconnection that severs divine communication.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as directionless spiritual silence with absent communication, blocked guidance, and severed sacred dialogue.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with maladaptive communication (psy-com-mal) in dialogue breakdown, fragmented connection (soc-con-fra) in severed relationships, and dysregulated neural connectivity (phy-neu-dys) in network disruption.
  academic_description: Research shows cessation of spiritual practices predicts relapse, increased distress, and existential isolation. Studies identify 'spiritual bypass' where individuals abandon practices after initial recovery, losing conscious contact. The phenomenon of 'practical atheism'—living as if God doesn't exist despite belief—correlates with addiction maintenance. Neuroscience reveals absence of contemplative practice leads to decreased prefrontal-limbic connectivity and increased default mode network fragmentation.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores practice history, communication barriers, and reasons for spiritual silence. Treatment addresses blocks while respecting resistance to forced practice. Interventions include exploring practice resistance, addressing spiritual injuries blocking communication, and finding accessible entry points. Common presentations include 'forgetting' to pray, feeling prayers bounce off ceiling, and complete practice cessation. Key is understanding silence as symptom—sometimes protecting from painful divine encounter, sometimes reflecting depression, sometimes indicating relapse risk.
  lay_description: Spiritual silence is when all communication with your higher power stops—no prayer, no meditation, no sense of connection at all. It's like a phone line that's been cut, leaving you unable to reach out even when desperate. This isn't peaceful quiet but deafening isolation, where you can't speak to the divine and hear nothing in return. In recovery, this silence often precedes relapse, as you lose touch with the spiritual resources that were sustaining you, falling back into the isolation that feeds addiction.
  foundational_themes: Divine silence, sacred muteness, transcendent disconnection, ultimate isolation
