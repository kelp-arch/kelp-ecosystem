  scope: Clear sacred values and spiritual principles that provide consistent ethical guidance and moral framework for life decisions, creating alignment between spiritual beliefs and actions.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the sacred meaning cluster's focus on spiritual significance by examining how sacred values provide purposeful ethical framework and guide meaningful life choices.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as clear articulation of sacred principles, consistent value-based decision making, and strong alignment between spiritual values and daily actions.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-bel-cor-ada (adaptive core beliefs), soc-cul-val-sha-coh (cohesive shared values), and phy-neu-exe-inh-reg (regulated inhibition supporting value-based choices).
  academic_description: Research on sacred values demonstrates their role in providing moral framework and life direction. Pargament's sanctification theory shows how perceiving values as sacred increases commitment and behavioral consistency. Studies indicate that individuals with clear sacred values show greater resilience, stronger recovery motivation, and more consistent ethical behavior. Sacred values function as superordinate goals that organize other life priorities and provide meaning structure.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores client's current sacred values, their clarity and consistency, and alignment with behavior. Interventions include values clarification exercises focusing on spiritual dimensions, exploration of how addiction violated sacred values, and work to realign actions with spiritual principles. Common issues include values confusion after losing religious framework, difficulty distinguishing authentic values from imposed ones, and shame about past violations of sacred principles. Treatment helps identify core sacred values, develop practices to embody them, and create accountability structures.
  lay_description: Sacred values are the spiritual principles that guide your life—what you hold as ultimately right and wrong, what matters most from a spiritual perspective. When these values are clear, you know what you stand for spiritually and make decisions accordingly. Your actions align with your deepest beliefs about what's sacred. In addiction, these values often get violated or abandoned, creating spiritual pain and moral injury.

  academic_description: Research shows that absence of sacred values correlates with increased vulnerability to addiction, reduced recovery stability, and greater moral distress. Studies indicate that moral relativism and values confusion predict poorer treatment outcomes and increased relapse risk. The absence of sacred framework for ethics leads to decision-making based solely on immediate gratification or external pressures, undermining long-term wellbeing.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies values confusion, moral relativism, and disconnect between any stated values and behavior. Interventions focus on exploring what might be sacred, examining consequences of living without clear values, and gradually discovering authentic spiritual principles. Common presentations include cynicism about all values, inability to identify what matters spiritually, and pattern of violating own stated principles. Treatment begins with small values experiments and builds toward coherent framework.
  lay_description: Without clear sacred values, life becomes morally confusing—nothing feels ultimately right or wrong, decisions lack spiritual grounding, and you drift without ethical anchor. You might say one thing but do another, or change your principles based on convenience. This creates a spiritual void where addiction thrives, as there's no sacred framework to protect against destructive choices.
