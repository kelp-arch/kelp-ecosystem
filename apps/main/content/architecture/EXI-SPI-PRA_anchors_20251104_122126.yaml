  - Disciplined meditation
  - Sustained contemplation
  - Mindful presence
  scope: Regular meditation practice with developing concentration, mindfulness cultivation, and present-moment awareness leading to neuroplastic changes and contemplative capacity.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the meditation dimension of contemplative practice, focusing on systematic engagement with awareness-based practices.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as consistent meditation practice with deepening focus, reduced mind-wandering, and cultivation of contemplative states.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-att-foc-ada (adaptive attention focus) and phy-neu-pla-reg (regulated neuroplasticity).
  academic_description: Davidson's contemplative neuroscience demonstrates meditation-induced neuroplastic changes in attention and emotion regulation circuits. Regular practice strengthens prefrontal control, reduces default mode network activity, and enhances interoceptive awareness. Studies show dose-dependent relationships between practice duration and neural changes.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores meditation history, current practice frequency, and quality of focus. Interventions include MBSR training, guided meditation instruction, and retreat participation. Common challenges include restlessness and expectation management. Treatment emphasizes starting with brief practices and gradually extending duration.
  lay_description: This is when meditation becomes a real part of your life - not just something you try occasionally but a daily practice that deepens over time. You develop the ability to sit quietly, focus your attention, and find stillness even when your mind wants to race.
  foundational_themes: Present-moment awareness, contemplative discipline, sacred attention
  experiential_processes: Breath awareness, body scanning, thought observation, consciousness exploration
  personal_relevance: Provides tools for managing cravings, accessing inner peace, and developing spiritual focus

  synonyms:
  - Meditation neglect
  - Contemplative avoidance
  - Mindfulness abandonment
  scope: Avoided or abandoned meditation practice with inability to sustain focus, extreme restlessness, and absence of contemplative capacity or awareness cultivation.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the meditation dimension of contemplative practice in its neglected state, showing avoidance of awareness-based practices.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as no meditation practice, aversion to stillness, immediate giving up when attempting practice, and lack of any contemplative development.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-att-foc-mal (maladaptive attention focus) and phy-neu-pla-dys (dysregulated neuroplasticity).
  academic_description: Research indicates meditation avoidance correlates with heightened default mode network activity, reduced prefrontal control, and impaired emotion regulation. Lack of contemplative practice maintains stress reactivity patterns and limits neuroplastic potential for attention training.
  clinical_description: Clients report inability to sit still, overwhelming mental chatter, or belief they 'can't meditate.' Interventions start with movement-based practices, brief guided sessions, or walking meditation. Treatment addresses underlying anxiety about stillness and gradually builds tolerance.
  lay_description: This is when the idea of sitting still and meditating feels impossible or pointless. Your mind races constantly, you can't focus for even a minute, and any attempt at meditation feels like torture so you avoid it completely.
  foundational_themes: Mental chaos, contemplative poverty, attention fragmentation
  experiential_processes: Constant distraction, thought proliferation, awareness avoidance, restless agitation
  personal_relevance: Maintains stress patterns, limits coping resources, and prevents development of inner peace

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the prayer dimension of contemplative practice, focusing on communicative and relational aspects of spiritual discipline.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as consistent prayer beyond crisis, felt sense of connection, gratitude expression, and deepening relationship through prayer.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with soc-rel-spi-coh (cohesive spiritual relationships) and psy-att-dev-ada (adaptive devotional attention).
  academic_description: Prayer research reveals activation of social cognition and attachment networks during prayer. Different prayer types (petitionary, contemplative, gratitude) produce distinct neural patterns. Regular prayer practice correlates with reduced anxiety, increased hope, and enhanced meaning-making in recovery.
  clinical_description: Assessment explores prayer history, current practices, and sense of connection. Interventions include centering prayer instruction, prayer journaling, and liturgical participation. Treatment individualizes prayer forms - some resonate with spoken prayer, others with silent contemplation.
  lay_description: This is when prayer becomes a real conversation rather than desperate pleading. You develop different ways to pray - sometimes asking for help, sometimes just sitting in quiet presence, sometimes overflowing with gratitude. Prayer becomes a lifeline that connects you to something greater.
  foundational_themes: Divine dialogue, sacred communication, spiritual intimacy
  experiential_processes: Petition and intercession, contemplative listening, gratitude expression, presence cultivation

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the prayer dimension of contemplative practice in its neglected state, showing absence of spiritual communication.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as no prayer practice, empty recitation without feeling, crisis-only prayer attempts, and sense of talking to emptiness.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with soc-rel-spi-fra (fragmented spiritual relationships) and psy-att-dev-mal (maladaptive devotional patterns).
  academic_description: Absence of prayer correlates with reduced activation in attachment and social cognition networks. Prayer avoidance or mechanical recitation fails to produce the anxiolytic and meaning-making benefits of authentic prayer, maintaining spiritual disconnection.
  clinical_description: Clients report feeling unheard, prayer feeling pointless, or only praying in desperation. Some mechanically recite memorized prayers without engagement. Interventions include simple prayer formats, written prayers, and exploring barriers to authentic communication.
  lay_description: This is when prayer feels like talking to a wall or you've given up trying altogether. Maybe you only pray when desperate, or you recite empty words from memory. There's no sense of connection, no feeling of being heard, just spiritual radio silence.
  foundational_themes: Divine absence, communication breakdown, spiritual isolation
  experiential_processes: Mechanical recitation, desperate pleading, spiritual muteness, connection absence
