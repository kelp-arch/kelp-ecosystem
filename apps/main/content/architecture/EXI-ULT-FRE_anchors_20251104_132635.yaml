Clients often present with elaborate justifications for why nothing is their fault. Interventions include gentle exploration of responsibility avoidance benefits, gradual introduction of accountability concepts, and addressing fears of being blamed or shamed.
  lay_description: This is when you constantly blame everyone and everything else for your problems - your parents, society, bad luck, or the drugs themselves.
