  scope: Represents the capacity to face death anxiety without defensive escape, transforming terror into acceptance and using mortality awareness as motivation for authentic living rather than substance-mediated denial.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the core death anxiety management aspect of mortality confrontation, focusing on the fundamental terror response system and its regulation through acceptance versus chemical buffering.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as existential courage to face mortality without substances, death acceptance that reduces anxiety naturally, and transformation of death awareness into life appreciation.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-anx-reg (anxiety regulation), phy-str-reg (stress response regulation), and soc-cop-coh (cohesive coping strategies) in managing fundamental existential terror.
  academic_description: Death anxiety acceptance involves non-defensive responses to mortality salience that reduce terror through habituation and meaning-making rather than avoidance. Terror Management Theory shows that death acceptance paradoxically reduces anxiety more effectively than denial. Research demonstrates that mindfulness-based death acceptance correlates with lower substance use and better recovery outcomes. Studies indicate that existential courage - the capacity to face finitude without defensive escape - predicts psychological wellbeing and reduced addiction severity.
  clinical_description: Clinical work focuses on developing death acceptance through graduated exposure to mortality themes, processing death anxiety without chemical buffering, and building existential courage. Assessment explores current death anxiety levels, substance use patterns following mortality reminders, and capacity for non-defensive death discussion. Interventions include death acceptance therapy, existential therapy approaches, and mindfulness of mortality exercises that reduce terror through acceptance rather than avoidance.
  lay_description: Death anxiety acceptance means being able to think about dying without needing drugs or alcohol to cope. Instead of running from the fear of death, you learn to accept it as natural and use that awareness to live more fully. This might mean talking openly about death, making peace with your mortality, or finding meaning despite knowing life ends.
  foundational_themes: Mortality as universal human condition, death as motivation for authentic living, acceptance as path to reduced anxiety
  experiential_processes: Facing death thoughts without panic, sitting with mortality awareness, transforming terror into acceptance

  - Mortality panic
  scope: Represents overwhelming death anxiety driving substance use for terror management, using chemicals to buffer existential dread and escape mortality awareness through intoxication.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the dysregulated death anxiety aspect of mortality confrontation, where terror becomes overwhelming and drives addictive escape rather than acceptance.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as panic responses to death reminders, immediate substance use following mortality triggers, and chronic chemical buffering of existential terror.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-anx-mal (anxiety dysregulation), phy-str-dys (stress response dysregulation), and soc-cop-fra (fragmented coping strategies) in failed terror management.
  academic_description: Death terror escape involves maladaptive responses to mortality salience through substance-mediated anxiety buffering. Research shows that high death anxiety predicts increased substance use severity and relapse risk. Terror Management Theory demonstrates how substances serve as proximal defense against death awareness, providing temporary relief from existential dread. Studies indicate that chemical terror management prevents natural habituation to death anxiety, maintaining the cycle of fear and escape.
  clinical_description: Clinical presentation includes panic at death reminders, immediate substance craving following mortality triggers, and inability to discuss death without chemical support. Assessment examines death anxiety severity, substance use patterns around mortality themes, and avoidance behaviors. Treatment addresses underlying terror through gradual exposure, developing non-chemical anxiety management, and processing traumatic death encounters that maintain the fear-escape cycle.
  lay_description: Death terror escape happens when thoughts of dying trigger such intense fear that you need drugs or alcohol to cope. You might panic when reminded of death, immediately use substances after funerals or near-death experiences, or stay high to avoid ever thinking about mortality. The substances temporarily numb the terror but prevent you from ever making peace with death.
  foundational_themes: Death as overwhelming terror, mortality as unbearable reality, substances as existential buffer
  experiential_processes: Panic at death awareness, chemical numbing of terror, avoidance of mortality themes
  personal_relevance: Maintains addiction through terror management needs, prevents death acceptance, blocks authentic engagement with finitude

  academic_description: Conscious death processing involves adaptive proximal defenses that allow immediate acknowledgment of mortality without suppression. Terror Management Theory distinguishes proximal defenses as conscious, rational responses to death thoughts. Research shows that conscious processing of death reminders, rather than suppression, leads to reduced anxiety and better psychological adjustment. Studies demonstrate that mindful awareness of death thoughts without judgment reduces their threatening nature.
  clinical_description: Clinical work develops capacity for conscious death acknowledgment through mindfulness techniques, cognitive restructuring of death thoughts, and practicing non-defensive responses to mortality reminders. Assessment examines ability to tolerate death thoughts, suppression tendencies, and immediate coping responses. Interventions include thought monitoring, acceptance-based approaches, and developing conscious processing skills for death-related content.
  lay_description: Conscious death processing means being able to think about death when it comes up without immediately pushing the thoughts away or using substances. When you see a funeral or hear about someone dying, you can acknowledge these reminders rationally rather than panicking or numbing yourself. You learn to let death thoughts exist without fighting them.
  foundational_themes: Death thoughts as natural occurrences, conscious acknowledgment as healthy response, rational processing of mortality
  experiential_processes: Noticing death thoughts without suppression, allowing mortality awareness, conscious acknowledgment of finitude
