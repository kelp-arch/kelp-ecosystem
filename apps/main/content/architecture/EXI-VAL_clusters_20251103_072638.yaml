    child_generation_role: You are a values assessment specialist trained in Schwartz Values Theory and ACT-based values clarification. You analyze how individuals identify core values across ten universal value dimensions (self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, universalism). You distinguish between purposeful states showing clear value hierarchies and authentic value expression versus directionless states showing value confusion, externally imposed values, and substance-use value dominance. You utilize values card sorts, life domain assessments, and values clarification protocols from Hayes' ACT framework.
    academic_description: Values clarification represents the foundational process of identifying and articulating personal values that guide life direction. Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values identifies ten universal value types organized along dimensions of self-enhancement vs self-transcendence and openness to change vs conservation. Research shows that value clarity—knowing what matters most—predicts well-being and life satisfaction. In addiction contexts, substance use often obscures authentic values, with drugs becoming the dominant organizing principle. Values clarification interventions help individuals rediscover pre-addiction values or develop new value hierarchies. ACT protocols use experiential exercises to connect individuals with deeply held values beyond immediate gratification. Studies demonstrate that clear value identification predicts treatment engagement and recovery motivation. The process involves distinguishing between intrinsic values (authentically chosen) and extrinsic values (imposed by others), with intrinsic value clarity associated with better outcomes.
    clinical_description: Clinical values clarification helps clients rediscover what truly matters beneath addiction's influence. Interventions begin with values card sorts where clients select and rank values across domains like family, work, spirituality, and health. Therapists use questions like "What kind of person do you want to be?" and "What would you stand for if addiction wasn't in the way?" to explore authentic values. The Sweet Spot exercise identifies times when clients felt most alive and authentic, revealing underlying values. Clinicians help differentiate between stated values (what clients say matters) and revealed values (what behavior suggests matters), addressing discrepancies non-judgmentally. Common challenges include value confusion from years of substance-focused living, difficulty accessing emotions that signal value importance, and distinguishing personal values from family or cultural expectations. Treatment involves exploring each life domain systematically, identifying 3-5 core values that feel most essential, and articulating why each value matters personally. The goal is developing a clear values compass to guide recovery decisions.
    lay_description: Values clarification is about figuring out what really matters to you in life—not what others think should matter, but what feels truly important in your heart. During addiction, drugs or alcohol often become the only thing that seems to matter, pushing aside things you once cared about like being a good parent, pursuing dreams, or maintaining integrity. This process helps you rediscover or newly identify your core values. You might explore different life areas—relationships, work, personal growth, fun—and ask yourself what you want each area to look like. Maybe you discover that being reliable matters deeply to you, or that creativity feeds your soul, or that helping others gives your life meaning. It's like clearing away fog to see the mountains that were always there. You learn to distinguish between values you've inherited from others ("I should value success") and values that resonate deeply with who you are ("I value authentic connection"). The goal is creating a clear picture of what you want your life to be about, giving you a North Star to navigate recovery decisions.

    scope: Encompasses the alignment between identified personal values and actual behavior, including psychological flexibility to act on values despite discomfort. Includes committed action, value-behavior gap analysis, and overcoming barriers to value-consistent behavior. Excludes values identification (clarification cluster) and motivational aspects of values (motivation cluster).
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster narrows the parent field's value-behavior alignment dimension to specifically examine how individuals translate their identified values into consistent action patterns.
    polarity_dimension: The consistency between values and behavior - ranging from purposeful (strong value-behavior alignment) to directionless (chronic value-behavior discrepancy).
    emergence: At the cluster level, value-action congruence exhibits emergent behavioral integrity—a consistent expression of values through action that transcends individual choices. This includes values momentum where value-consistent actions build on each other, flexibility resilience where individuals maintain values despite obstacles, and integrated authenticity where behavior naturally flows from values.
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Action-clarification interface where clear values enable aligned action
      - Action-agency interface where volitional control supports value-based behavior
      - Action-motivation interface where value-action alignment reinforces autonomous motivation
    child_generation_role: You are a psychological flexibility specialist focusing on value-behavior alignment in addiction recovery. You analyze committed action patterns, psychological barriers to values-based behavior, and the role of experiential avoidance in maintaining value-behavior gaps. You distinguish between purposeful states showing consistent value-guided action despite discomfort versus directionless states showing chronic value-behavior discrepancy and avoidance-based decision making. You apply Hayes' psychological flexibility model, examining acceptance, defusion, and committed action processes that enable value-consistent behavior.
    academic_description: Value-action congruence examines the critical translation of identified values into consistent behavioral patterns. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy's psychological flexibility model emphasizes committed action—persisting in value-guided behavior despite psychological barriers. Research demonstrates that value-behavior discrepancy predicts psychological distress, while alignment promotes well-being. In addiction, the value-behavior gap becomes profound, with individuals repeatedly acting against stated values, creating moral injury and shame. Psychological inflexibility—fusion with thoughts, experiential avoidance, and disconnection from values—maintains this gap. Studies show that increasing psychological flexibility through acceptance, cognitive defusion, and present-moment awareness enables value-consistent action. The committed action process involves setting value-based goals, identifying barriers, developing willingness to experience discomfort, and taking steps despite internal obstacles. Research indicates that value-behavior congruence mediates the relationship between values clarification and positive outcomes, suggesting that knowing values alone is insufficient without behavioral alignment.
    clinical_description: Clinical work on value-action congruence helps clients close the gap between what they value and how they act. Treatment begins by mapping current behavior against identified values, revealing discrepancies without judgment. The Matrix exercise plots behaviors as toward or away from values, and internal experiences as helpful or unhelpful, clarifying patterns. Clinicians explore barriers to value-consistent action—fear, discomfort, cravings, social pressure—and develop psychological flexibility to act despite these obstacles. Committed action plans break down value-based goals into small, specific steps. The "willing hands" exercise teaches clients to take value-guided action even when minds resist. Common challenges include all-or-nothing thinking about values, using values as rules rather than directions, and confusing goals with values. Therapists help clients recognize choice points throughout the day where they can move toward or away from values. Behavioral experiments test taking small value-consistent actions, building evidence that discomfort is tolerable. Success is measured not by perfection but by increasingly frequent value-aligned choices.
    lay_description: Value-action congruence is about actually living according to what matters to you, not just knowing what's important. It's the difference between saying family is everything while consistently choosing substances over family time, or valuing health while avoiding self-care. In addiction, this gap between values and actions often becomes huge—you know what you should do, what aligns with who you want to be, but you keep doing the opposite. This creates deep shame and self-hatred. Recovery involves learning to act on your values even when it's uncomfortable or when your mind tells you it's too hard. It's like learning to walk toward what matters even when fear or cravings try to pull you backward. You practice taking small steps aligned with your values—making that phone call, showing up to that commitment, saying no to that temptation—even when every fiber wants to avoid or escape. Over time, these small value-consistent actions build momentum. You learn that you can feel anxious AND still act courageously, have cravings AND still choose recovery. It's not about perfect alignment but about increasingly choosing actions that reflect who you want to be.

Excludes agency as motivation (motivation cluster) and agency in service of values (value-action cluster).
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster narrows the parent field's agency and responsibility dimensions to specifically focus on the subjective sense of being the author of one's actions and life direction.
    polarity_dimension: The strength of perceived personal agency - ranging from purposeful (strong sense of self-authorship and choice) to directionless (learned helplessness and external locus of control).
    emergence: At the cluster level, volitional agency exhibits emergent agentic empowerment—an integrated sense of authoring one's life story that transcends individual choices. This includes choice consciousness where individuals recognize decision points throughout daily life, responsibility integration where past ownership and future agency unite, and volitional momentum where exercising agency strengthens future agency.

    child_generation_role: You are an agency development specialist trained in self-determination theory and existential approaches to personal freedom. You analyze perceived behavioral control, locus of control orientation, choice awareness, and responsibility acceptance patterns. You distinguish between purposeful states showing strong personal agency, internal attribution, and ownership of choices versus directionless states showing learned helplessness, external blame, and perceived lack of control. You apply Deci & Ryan's autonomy concepts, Rotter's locus of control theory, and existential notions of freedom and responsibility from Yalom and Frankl.
    academic_description: Volitional agency examines the fundamental sense of being the author of one's actions and life direction. Self-determination theory's autonomy dimension emphasizes the experience of volition and self-endorsement in action. Bandura's concept of human agency includes intentionality, forethought, self-reactiveness, and self-reflectiveness as core properties. In addiction, agency becomes compromised through neurobiological changes that impair voluntary control and psychological patterns of learned helplessness. Research shows that perceived behavioral control predicts both intention and behavior change. Locus of control studies demonstrate that internal attribution—believing outcomes result from personal actions—predicts better recovery outcomes than external attribution. Existential perspectives emphasize that recognizing freedom creates anxiety but also possibility for authentic choice. The development of agency involves acknowledging past choices without paralysis, recognizing current choice points, and accepting responsibility for future direction. Studies indicate that interventions enhancing sense of agency improve treatment retention, reduce relapse, and increase quality of life. The cluster examines how individuals reclaim authorship of their lives after experiencing the powerlessness of addiction.
    clinical_description: Clinical agency development helps clients recognize and exercise personal choice and responsibility. Work begins by exploring current locus of control—do clients feel like victims of circumstance or authors of their experience? Choice awareness exercises identify decision points throughout the day, challenging the narrative of powerlessness. Responsibility work involves accepting ownership of past actions without drowning in shame while embracing power to shape the future. Clinicians help clients distinguish between what they can and cannot control, focusing energy on their sphere of influence. Common challenges include learned helplessness from repeated failures, external blame patterns that avoid responsibility, and fear of freedom's burden. Therapists use exercises like the "choice point tool" to recognize moments of agency, and "responsibility pie" to fairly distribute causation. Clients practice making small autonomous choices daily, building evidence of personal agency. The approach balances validating real constraints (trauma, addiction's neurobiology) while empowering choice within those constraints. Success involves clients increasingly seeing themselves as active agents rather than passive victims, recognizing that even in difficult circumstances, they retain some freedom to choose their response.
    lay_description: Volitional agency is about recognizing that you have choices and the power to direct your own life, even when it doesn't feel that way. In addiction, you often feel completely powerless—like the substance controls you, like you have no choice but to use, like you're a victim of your circumstances or your brain. Recovery involves reclaiming your sense of personal power and recognizing that you're the author of your life story, not just a character being written by addiction. This means accepting responsibility for past choices without drowning in shame—yes, you made those decisions, even if addiction influenced them heavily. More importantly, it means recognizing you have choices now and in the future. Even in tough situations, you can choose how to respond. You might not control having cravings, but you control whether you act on them. You can't change your past, but you can choose your next step. It's about moving from "I can't help it" or "It's not my fault" to "I have choices, even if they're hard." This isn't about blame—it's about empowerment. When you recognize your agency, you stop being addiction's victim and start being recovery's author.

Includes intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, identified regulation, and autonomy-supportive environments. Excludes values as motivational content (clarification cluster) and agency as motivational prerequisite (agency cluster).
    parent_scope_inheritance: This cluster narrows the parent field's autonomous motivation dimension to specifically examine the quality and internalization of motivation for recovery and value-based living.
    polarity_dimension: The degree of motivational autonomy - ranging from purposeful (autonomous, self-determined motivation) to directionless (controlled motivation or amotivation).
    emergence: At the cluster level, autonomous motivation exhibits emergent motivational coherence—an integrated, self-sustaining drive that transcends specific reasons for change. This includes motivational resilience where autonomous motivation persists despite setbacks, internalization momentum where external motivations become increasingly self-determined, and authentic engagement where actions flow from genuine interest rather than pressure.

      - Motivation-values interface where identified values provide motivational content
      - Motivation-agency interface where sense of agency enables autonomous motivation
      - Motivation-action interface where motivational quality influences behavioral persistence
    child_generation_role: You are an autonomous motivation researcher specializing in self-determination theory applications to addiction recovery. You analyze motivation quality along the controlled-autonomous continuum, examining external regulation, introjection, identification, integration, and intrinsic motivation. You distinguish between purposeful states showing autonomous motivation, intrinsic interest, and self-endorsed reasons for change versus directionless states showing controlled motivation, amotivation, and externally driven compliance. You apply Deci & Ryan's Basic Psychological Needs Theory, examining how autonomy, competence, and relatedness support influence motivational quality.
    academic_description: Autonomous motivation examines the quality and internalization of drive for recovery and behavior change. Self-determination theory distinguishes between controlled motivation (external pressure, guilt, shame) and autonomous motivation (personal value, intrinsic interest). Research demonstrates that autonomous motivation predicts better treatment outcomes, longer abstinence, and greater well-being than controlled motivation. The theory identifies a continuum from amotivation through external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration to intrinsic motivation. In addiction, motivation often begins as external (avoiding consequences) but must internalize for sustained recovery. Basic Psychological Needs Theory posits that satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs facilitates autonomous motivation. Studies show that autonomy-supportive treatment environments—offering choice, providing rationale, acknowledging feelings—enhance motivation quality. The internalization process involves moving from "I have to" through "I should" to "I choose to" and ultimately "I want to." Research indicates that even when behavior appears similar, autonomous motivation leads to greater persistence, performance, and psychological health than controlled motivation. The cluster examines how individuals develop genuine, self-determined reasons for recovery that sustain long-term change.
    clinical_description: Clinical work on autonomous motivation helps clients develop internal, personally meaningful reasons for recovery. Assessment explores current motivation quality—are clients changing to avoid punishment, please others, or because change aligns with personal values? Motivational interviewing techniques explore and strengthen autonomous motivation by evoking clients' own reasons for change. Clinicians provide autonomy support by offering choices, explaining rationales, and validating feelings rather than pressuring or coercing. Common challenges include over-reliance on external motivators (drug tests, legal requirements), introjected motivation driven by shame, and amotivation from repeated failures. Treatment helps clients connect recovery behaviors to personal values and intrinsic interests. The "motivation ruler" explores different reasons for change, identifying which feel most personally meaningful. Clinicians help internalize external motivations—transforming "I have to stay clean for probation" into "I choose sobriety because it allows me to be the parent I want to be." Success involves clients increasingly experiencing recovery as self-chosen rather than imposed, finding genuine interest and satisfaction in recovery activities, and maintaining motivation even when external pressures decrease.
    lay_description: Autonomous motivation is about wanting recovery for your own reasons, not because others are forcing you. There's a big difference between staying clean because you'll go to jail if you don't (external pressure) versus staying clean because you genuinely want the life sobriety offers (internal drive). In early recovery, motivation often starts external—family threats, legal consequences, job loss. That's okay as a starting point, but for lasting change, motivation needs to come from within. This means finding your own personal reasons that matter to you- maybe you want to be present for your kids, pursue a dream addiction stole, or simply like who you are when sober. It's the difference between "I have to" and "I choose to." When motivation is truly yours, it feels different—less like grinding obligation and more like moving toward something you want. You might even find aspects of recovery you genuinely enjoy, not just endure. The key is that nobody can give you this motivation; you have to discover or develop it yourself. When you do, recovery stops feeling like something done to you and starts feeling like something you're doing for yourself.
