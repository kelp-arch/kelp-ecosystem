  - Sporadic occurrence
  - Low genetic loading
  - Minimal family history
  scope: Low familial aggregation of addiction with sporadic occurrence, minimal affected relatives, low sibling recurrence risk, and predominant environmental determination of vulnerability allowing effective prevention through environmental modification.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the family studies and familial aggregation component of heritability systems, focusing on patterns of low genetic clustering within families.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as isolated or absent cases within family pedigrees, with addiction occurring sporadically rather than clustering across generations, indicating low genetic transmission and greater environmental determination.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with adaptive family attachment patterns (psy-att-fam-ada), cohesive family structures (soc-fam-str-coh), and purposeful family legacy (exi-leg-fam-pur) where healthy family dynamics support resilience.
  academic_description: Family studies show low lambda values (sibling recurrence risk ratio <2), minimal segregation within pedigrees, and heritability estimates at the lower bound (20-30%). Environmental factors account for the majority of variance in liability. Adoption studies demonstrate stronger correlation with adoptive rather than biological family environment.
  clinical_description: Negative or minimal family history on structured assessment, with at most one affected second-degree relative. Standard prevention approaches are effective. Risk assessment focuses on environmental factors like peer influence, trauma exposure, and substance availability. Genetic counseling emphasizes modifiable risk factors.
  lay_description: Addiction doesn't run in the family - if it occurs, it's usually an isolated case rather than a pattern across relatives. This means environmental factors like stress, peer pressure, or trauma are the main drivers, making prevention through lifestyle and environment changes highly effective.
  key_mediators: Normal allele frequencies for addiction risk variants, balanced neurotransmitter synthesis genes, intact metabolic enzyme variants
  key_mechanisms: Low genetic correlation between family members for addiction traits, predominant unique environmental variance, minimal additive genetic variance
  clinical_relevance: Lower baseline risk allows standard prevention to be effective, environmental interventions show good efficacy, lower need for intensive monitoring

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with maladaptive family attachment patterns (psy-att-fam-mal), fragmented family structures (soc-fam-str-fra), and directionless family legacy (exi-leg-fam-dir) where intergenerational transmission perpetuates vulnerability.
  academic_description: Family studies demonstrate high lambda values (sibling recurrence risk ratio >8), clear segregation patterns, and heritability estimates at upper bounds (50-60%). Multiple affected first-degree relatives indicate oligogenic or polygenic transmission with high penetrance. Adoption studies show stronger correlation with biological family regardless of rearing environment.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with specific behavioral patterns (psy-beh-pat-ada), targeted coping mechanisms (psy-cop-str-ada), and focused existential themes (exi-mea-foc-pur) where vulnerability is circumscribed rather than generalized.
  academic_description: Genetic correlation studies show rg values <0.3 between different substances. Factor analyses identify substance-specific genetic factors with minimal common factor contribution. Distinct genes affect alcohol (ADH1B, ALDH2) versus nicotine (CHRNA5) versus opioid (OPRM1) use disorders.
  clinical_description: Genetic risk confined to specific substances allows targeted prevention. Family history of alcohol problems doesn't strongly predict opioid risk. Substance-specific genetic testing and prevention strategies can be employed. Treatment can focus on particular vulnerability.
  lay_description: Genetic risk for one substance doesn't necessarily mean risk for others - someone might have genes that make alcohol problematic but not affect their response to other drugs. This allows for targeted prevention based on specific genetic vulnerabilities.

Common factor analyses identify general addiction liability accounting for majority of genetic variance. Shared genes affect reward processing, impulse control, and stress response across substances.
  clinical_description: High genetic correlation means vulnerability to one substance indicates risk for others. Family history of any addiction increases risk for all substances. Requires broad-spectrum prevention addressing general addiction liability. Polysubstance use common.
  lay_description: Genetic risk for addiction is general rather than specific - the same genetic factors that make someone vulnerable to alcohol problems also increase risk for nicotine, cannabis, and other substances. It's like having a general sensitivity rather than a specific allergy.
  key_mediators: Shared variants in dopamine system genes, common stress response alleles, general impulse control variants
  key_mechanisms: Common reward pathway disruption, shared impulse control deficits, general stress vulnerability, cross-substance sensitization
