  synonyms:
  - Hypozincemia
  - Zinc depletion
  - Trace mineral deficiency
  scope: Zinc deficiency impairing immune function, wound healing, and sensory perception. Results in increased infection susceptibility, delayed healing, and dysgeusia with impact on nutritional recovery.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Represents the pathological zinc depletion aspect of nutritional metabolism, emphasizing immune compromise and impaired tissue repair that complicate physical recovery.
  polarity_expression: Expressed as depleted zinc stores causing immune dysfunction, impaired wound healing, taste abnormalities, and reduced protein synthesis capacity.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-imm-ada-dys through immunosuppression, phy-gas-muc-dys through increased permeability, and psy-emo-anh-mal through taste-related anhedonia.
  academic_description: Zinc deficiency with levels <70μg/dL impairs function of >300 zinc-dependent enzymes, disrupting protein synthesis and DNA repair. T-cell dysfunction and reduced cytokine production increase infection susceptibility. Impaired collagen cross-linking and reduced growth factor production delay wound healing. Loss of taste acuity from taste bud atrophy affects nutritional intake. Increased intestinal permeability from tight junction disruption. Reduced testosterone synthesis affects mood and libido.
  clinical_description: Presents with frequent infections, slow wound healing, hair loss, and taste changes. Serum zinc <70μg/dL indicates deficiency. Dysgeusia affects appetite and nutrition. Skin lesions, particularly perioral and acral dermatitis. Diarrhea worsens deficiency through losses. Treatment with zinc sulfate 220mg daily for 2-3 months. Monitor copper levels as zinc supplementation can induce copper deficiency. Common in alcohol use disorder from poor intake and increased urinary losses.
  lay_description: Without enough zinc, your immune system weakens, making you catch every cold and infection. Cuts and wounds heal slowly, food tastes bland or metallic, and you might lose hair. This makes recovery harder as your body can't repair itself properly. Heavy drinking depletes zinc through poor diet and increased losses. Supplements can restore immune function and taste within weeks.

  synonyms:
  - Normal absorption
  - Intact bioavailability
  - Nutrient uptake efficiency
  scope: Intact gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic storage, and transport protein synthesis enabling optimal micronutrient bioavailability. Maintains nutrient delivery to tissues through functional enterocytes, adequate intrinsic factor, and appropriate carrier proteins.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the absorption and bioavailability component of micronutrient metabolism, addressing the gateway processes that determine actual nutrient utilization regardless of intake.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as intact intestinal barrier function, adequate digestive enzymes, normal transport proteins, and sufficient hepatic storage maintaining tissue nutrient delivery.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-gas-muc-reg through mucosal integrity, phy-hep-syn-reg through protein synthesis, and phy-met-ene-reg through ATP-dependent transport.
  academic_description: Optimal bioavailability requires intact intestinal mucosa with functional enterocytes expressing specific transporters (DMT1 for iron, NaP2b for phosphate, TRPV6 for calcium). Adequate gastric acid production enables B12-intrinsic factor binding and mineral solubilization. Pancreatic enzymes release protein-bound vitamins. Hepatic synthesis of transport proteins (transferrin, transcobalamin, retinol-binding protein) enables systemic distribution. Adequate hepatic storage capacity maintains buffer against dietary variation.
  clinical_description: Normal absorption indicated by adequate micronutrient levels despite standard dietary intake. Albumin >3.5g/dL and prealbumin >20mg/dL suggest intact synthetic function. Fat-soluble vitamin levels reflect absorption and storage. Absence of steatorrhea indicates fat absorption. Intrinsic factor and pancreatic function support B12 and fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Recovery involves healing gut mucosa and restoring hepatic function over weeks to months.
  lay_description: Your gut needs to be healthy to absorb vitamins and minerals from food. Think of it like a selective filter - damaged intestines can't properly absorb nutrients even if you eat well. Your liver stores many vitamins and makes proteins that carry nutrients through your blood. When these systems work properly, nutrients from your diet actually reach your cells where they're needed.
  key_mediators: Intrinsic factor, pancreatic enzymes, bile acids, transport proteins (albumin, transferrin, transcobalamin), enterocyte transporters
  key_mechanisms: Active transport, facilitated diffusion, receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein-bound transport, hepatic storage and release
  clinical_relevance: Nutrient delivery optimization, prevention of deficiencies despite adequate intake, recovery support, treatment response
  assessment_methods: Albumin/prealbumin levels, fat-soluble vitamin levels, stool fat content, D-xylose test, intrinsic factor antibodies
  interventions: Gut healing protocols, digestive enzyme support, probiotics, adequate protein intake, treatment of underlying GI conditions

  synonyms:
  - Impaired absorption
  - Bioavailability deficit
  - Nutrient malabsorption
  scope: Malabsorption from damaged intestinal mucosa, reduced transport proteins, and depleted hepatic stores causing multiple micronutrient deficiencies despite adequate intake. Results in treatment resistance and prolonged recovery.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Represents the pathological malabsorption aspect of nutritional metabolism, emphasizing how gut and liver damage create systemic nutrient deficiencies regardless of supplementation.
  polarity_expression: Expressed as damaged intestinal barrier, reduced absorptive surface, depleted transport proteins, and exhausted hepatic stores causing systemic micronutrient depletion.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-gas-muc-dys through mucosal damage, phy-hep-syn-dys through reduced protein synthesis, and phy-imm-bar-dys through increased permeability.
  academic_description: Malabsorption results from enterocyte damage reducing brush border enzymes and transporters. Alcohol-induced villous atrophy decreases absorptive surface area. Reduced gastric acid and intrinsic factor impair B12 absorption. Pancreatic insufficiency limits fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Bacterial overgrowth consumes nutrients and produces toxins. Hypoalbuminemia from hepatic dysfunction reduces nutrient transport capacity. Depleted hepatic stores cannot buffer against poor absorption.
  clinical_description: Presents with multiple deficiencies despite supplementation. Steatorrhea indicates fat malabsorption affecting vitamins A, D, E, K. Low albumin <3.5g/dL and prealbumin <20mg/dL indicate protein malnutrition. Weight loss despite adequate intake. May require parenteral nutrition initially. Recovery requires months of gut healing - glutamine, zinc, probiotics support repair. Pancreatic enzymes may help. Address bacterial overgrowth if present.
  lay_description: When your gut is damaged from alcohol or drugs, it can't absorb nutrients properly - like trying to fill a bucket with holes in it. Even if you eat well and take vitamins, they pass through without being absorbed. Your liver, which normally stores vitamins, is also depleted. This means you need higher doses of supplements, sometimes through injections, while your gut heals over several months.
  key_mediators: Reduced intrinsic factor, decreased pancreatic enzymes, altered bile acids, hypoalbuminemia, damaged enterocytes, bacterial overgrowth
  key_mechanisms: Villous atrophy, reduced absorptive surface, impaired active transport, bacterial competition, increased intestinal permeability
  clinical_relevance: Multiple deficiency syndromes, treatment resistance, prolonged recovery, increased infection risk, failure to thrive
