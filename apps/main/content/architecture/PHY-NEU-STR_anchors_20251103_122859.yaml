  - Appropriate fear conditioning
  - Adaptive threat detection
  - Normal amygdala reactivity
  scope: Basolateral and central amygdala nuclei showing appropriate fear conditioning to actual threats, successful fear extinction when threats pass, and proportionate activation to danger cues. Maintains ability to discriminate between safety and threat signals.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the amygdala fear processing component of stress-emotion systems, focusing on appropriate threat detection and fear learning rather than the hyperactive fear responses seen in addiction.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as appropriate fear responses that match actual threat levels, with successful extinction learning and recovery after stress exposure.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-att-ada (adaptive attention to threats), soc-fam-bou-coh (cohesive safety boundaries), and exi-saf-thr-pur (purposeful threat assessment).
  academic_description: Research demonstrates normal amygdala activation patterns with appropriate habituation to repeated stimuli. Fear conditioning shows good discrimination between CS+ and CS- stimuli. Extinction learning proceeds normally with vmPFC effectively inhibiting amygdala response when threats are no longer present. NMDA receptor function supports fear extinction. D-cycloserine augmentation of exposure therapy enhances extinction learning through NMDA partial agonism.
  clinical_description: Patients show normal startle responses and can differentiate real threats from perceived ones. Fear extinction training and exposure therapy are effective. Assessment includes fear conditioning paradigms and psychophysiological monitoring of fear responses. Treatment focuses on maintaining healthy fear processing through stress management and occasional exposure exercises to prevent avoidance patterns from developing.
  lay_description: Your brain's alarm system works properly - it goes off when there's real danger but quiets down when you're safe. You can learn which situations are actually threatening and which just feel scary but aren't dangerous. After something frightening happens, you're able to calm down and move on rather than staying stuck in fear mode.
  key_mediators: NMDA receptors, GABA, glutamate, BDNF, endocannabinoids
  key_mechanisms: Fear conditioning and extinction, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, inhibitory tone from vmPFC, endocannabinoid-mediated extinction
  clinical_relevance: Protective against PTSD development, supports resilience to trauma, enables effective exposure therapy

  - Hyperactive amygdala
  - Impaired fear extinction
  - Fear overgeneralization
  scope: Hyperactive amygdala response to minor threats and drug cues, with impaired fear extinction and overgeneralization of fear to safe contexts. Shows persistent activation even after threat removal and poor discrimination between safety and danger signals.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the pathological amygdala hyperactivity within stress-emotion systems that drives anxiety, hypervigilance, and stress-induced drug craving in addiction.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as exaggerated fear responses to minimal threats, failure of fear extinction, and generalization of fear to non-threatening stimuli and contexts.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-att-mal (maladaptive threat bias), soc-fam-bou-fra (fragmented safety boundaries), and exi-saf-thr-dir (directionless threat assessment).
  academic_description: Studies show amygdala hyperactivation to both threat and neutral stimuli, with reduced habituation over time. Fear conditioning demonstrates poor CS+/CS- discrimination and resistance to extinction. Reduced vmPFC control over amygdala creates disinhibited fear responses. Impaired endocannabinoid signaling disrupts extinction consolidation. Chronic stress and drug use lead to dendritic hypertrophy in basolateral amygdala, increasing excitability.
  clinical_description: Patients exhibit exaggerated startle responses, generalized anxiety, and fear of non-threatening situations. Fear persists despite safety learning attempts. Assessment reveals elevated amygdala activity on neuroimaging and poor fear extinction in behavioral tasks. Treatment requires intensive prolonged exposure, EMDR for trauma processing, and propranolol to disrupt reconsolidation of fear memories. Pharmacological dampening with prazosin or propranolol may be necessary.
  lay_description: Your brain's alarm system is stuck in overdrive, going off constantly even when you're safe. Small worries feel like major threats, and you can't seem to calm down even when the danger has passed. It's exhausting to feel on edge all the time, and drugs might be the only thing that turns down the volume on this constant state of alarm.
  key_mediators: Excessive glutamate, reduced GABA, elevated CRF in amygdala, impaired endocannabinoids, high CREB

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-emo-anx-ada (adaptive anxiety), exi-mea-unc-pur (purposeful uncertainty navigation), and soc-env-pre-coh (cohesive environmental monitoring).
  academic_description: The BNST shows appropriate activation to unpredictable threats while maintaining normal baseline activity during safe periods. CRF and orexin signaling remain balanced, supporting vigilance without hyperarousal. Connections with prefrontal cortex allow cognitive appraisal to modulate BNST activity. Research shows normal habituation to repeated uncertain threats and preserved safety signal processing.
  clinical_description: Patients maintain appropriate concern about future challenges without excessive worry. They can tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity in daily life. Assessment shows normal anxiety scores and ability to engage in approach behaviors despite uncertainty. Interventions focus on maintaining this balance through mindfulness practices and cognitive flexibility training to prevent escalation to pathological anxiety.
  lay_description: You have a healthy level of caution about uncertain situations - enough to keep you prepared but not so much that it stops you from living your life. You can handle not knowing what's going to happen without constantly worrying about worst-case scenarios. Your anxiety serves as a helpful signal rather than a constant burden.
  key_mediators: Balanced CRF, orexin, GABA, neuropeptide Y, serotonin

  polarity_expression: Manifests as persistent background anxiety, excessive worry about potential threats, and inability to feel safe even in secure environments.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-emo-anx-mal (maladaptive anxiety), exi-mea-unc-dir (directionless in uncertainty), and soc-env-pre-fra (fragmented environmental assessment).
  academic_description: BNST shows tonically elevated activity with excessive CRF and reduced neuropeptide Y signaling. Heightened responses to unpredictability with failure to habituate to uncertain threats. Disrupted prefrontal regulation allows unchecked BNST activation. Chronic drug use and withdrawal states further sensitize BNST circuits, creating persistent negative affective states that drive drug seeking through negative reinforcement.
  clinical_description: Patients experience chronic worry, inability to relax, and constant feeling of impending doom. They cannot tolerate uncertainty and engage in excessive checking or avoidance behaviors. Assessment reveals elevated trait anxiety, poor uncertainty tolerance, and BNST hyperactivity on imaging. Treatment includes anxiolytics like buspirone, CBT for worry, and intensive uncertainty exposure exercises. Long-acting benzodiazepines may be needed initially.
  lay_description: You feel constantly on edge, like something bad is about to happen even when everything seems fine. Not knowing what's coming next feels unbearable, and you find yourself always preparing for the worst. This background anxiety is exhausting, and substances might be the only thing that provides temporary relief from this constant state of worry.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the neuroendocrine stress hormone component of stress-emotion systems, focusing on maintaining adaptive cortisol patterns that support resilience rather than vulnerability.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as appropriate cortisol peaks in the morning for alertness, gradual decline through the day, and proportionate acute responses to stressors with quick recovery.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-cir-sle-reg (regulated sleep-wake cycles), psy-tem-str-ada (adaptive stress tolerance), and phy-imm-inf-reg (regulated inflammation).
  academic_description: Research shows robust cortisol awakening response (CAR) with 50-75% increase within 30 minutes of waking. Clear diurnal rhythm with evening levels 75% lower than morning peak. Acute stressors produce 2-3 fold increase with return to baseline within 60-90 minutes. Negative feedback through hippocampal and prefrontal glucocorticoid receptors remains intact. FKBP5 and other stress-related genes show normal expression patterns.
  clinical_description: Patients show healthy energy in the morning and natural fatigue in the evening. They respond appropriately to acute stressors and recover quickly. Assessment via salivary cortisol shows normal CAR and diurnal slope. Sleep quality is good with natural circadian alignment. Interventions focus on maintaining these patterns through regular sleep schedules, exercise, and stress management techniques.
  lay_description: Your body's stress hormone system works like a well-tuned thermostat - it kicks in when you need energy or face challenges, then turns off so you can rest and recover. You feel alert in the morning and naturally tired at night. When stressful things happen, you respond appropriately and then return to feeling calm once the situation passes.

  scope: Dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with flattened diurnal rhythm, blunted acute stress response, and elevated baseline cortisol. Shows absent or reduced cortisol awakening response, elevated evening cortisol, and slow recovery from stressors.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the pathological neuroendocrine dysfunction within stress-emotion systems that creates allostatic load and maintains stress vulnerability in addiction.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as chronically elevated baseline cortisol with paradoxically blunted responses to acute stressors, creating a state of persistent biological stress without adaptive responsiveness.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-cir-sle-dys (dysregulated sleep), psy-tem-str-mal (maladaptive stress response), and phy-imm-inf-dys (dysregulated inflammation).
  academic_description: Studies demonstrate flattened cortisol diurnal rhythm with CAR reduced by 30-50% or absent entirely. Evening cortisol remains elevated, reducing the diurnal variation to less than 50%. Acute stress produces minimal cortisol increase despite subjective distress. Glucocorticoid receptor resistance develops from chronic elevation, with altered FKBP5 expression. Hippocampal volume reduction impairs negative feedback. This creates allostatic load contributing to metabolic, immune, and cognitive dysfunction.
  clinical_description: Patients report feeling 'tired but wired' with poor morning energy despite insomnia. They feel overwhelmed by minor stressors yet show blunted cortisol response to acute challenges. Assessment reveals flattened cortisol curve and may show metabolic syndrome markers. Treatment includes circadian rhythm restoration, mifepristone for GR antagonism in severe cases, and intensive stress reduction. Addressing sleep disturbance is critical.
  lay_description: Your stress system is like a smoke alarm with dying batteries - it's constantly making noise in the background (high baseline stress) but doesn't respond properly when there's actual smoke (real stressors). You feel exhausted but can't rest properly, and minor problems feel overwhelming while your body doesn't give you the energy boost needed for real challenges.
  key_mediators: Chronically elevated cortisol, reduced ACTH response, GR resistance, altered FKBP5, inflammatory cytokines

  academic_description: The locus coeruleus shows phasic firing patterns with appropriate tonic baseline. Alpha-2 autoreceptors provide effective negative feedback preventing excessive norepinephrine release. Normal coupling between LC activity and pupil diameter indicates intact arousal regulation. Heart rate variability remains high, indicating good parasympathetic-sympathetic balance. Norepinephrine appropriately enhances signal-to-noise ratio in cortical processing.
  clinical_description: Patients maintain calm alertness with ability to respond to challenges without excessive arousal. Sleep onset occurs naturally without hyperarousal. Heart rate variability is normal with good parasympathetic tone. Assessment shows normal startle response and pupillometry. Interventions focus on maintaining balance through regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management practices.
  lay_description: Your body's alertness system works like a good cup of coffee - it wakes you up when you need to focus but doesn't leave you jittery or unable to relax. You can pay attention when necessary and calm down when it's time to rest. Your heart rate speeds up during exercise or excitement but returns to normal quickly afterward.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-aut-sym-dys (sympathetic overdrive), psy-att-hyp-mal (maladaptive hypervigilance), and phy-car-rat-dys (dysregulated heart rate).
  academic_description: Research shows tonically elevated LC firing with loss of phasic signaling specificity. Alpha-2 autoreceptor desensitization fails to control norepinephrine release. Chronic elevation leads to beta-receptor downregulation yet paradoxical hypersensitivity to arousal. Reduced heart rate variability indicates sympathetic dominance. During withdrawal, noradrenergic storm occurs with massive NE release. This hyperactivity drives anxiety, insomnia, and stress-induced reinstatement.
  clinical_description: Patients experience persistent restlessness, exaggerated startle, sweating, and tremor. Insomnia with difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakening is common. They report feeling constantly 'on edge' with inability to relax. Assessment shows reduced HRV, elevated catecholamines, and dilated pupils. Treatment includes alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, guanfacine), beta-blockers for peripheral symptoms, and prazosin for nightmares and sleep.
  lay_description: Your body's alarm system is stuck in the 'on' position, making you feel constantly wired and unable to relax. Your heart races, you startle easily, and you can't seem to calm down even when trying to sleep. It's like having too much caffeine all the time, even when you haven't had any.

  academic_description: CRF neurons in paraventricular nucleus and central amygdala show appropriate stress-induced activation with rapid return to baseline. CRF1 receptors maintain normal sensitivity without desensitization. Balance between CRF and anti-stress peptides like NPY and oxytocin is maintained. CRF appropriately coordinates HPA axis, sympathetic, and behavioral stress responses without excessive activation. Normal CRF-dopamine interactions preserve hedonic capacity.
  clinical_description: Patients maintain emotional resilience with ability to experience pleasure between stressors. They show appropriate concern during challenges without persistent dysphoria. Mood remains stable with normal hedonic capacity. Assessment shows normal responses to stress with preserved positive affect. Interventions focus on maintaining this balance through stress management and positive activities.
  lay_description: Your brain's stress coordination system works properly - it mobilizes your resources when facing challenges but doesn't keep you in a constant state of distress. You can still enjoy life's pleasures and maintain a generally positive mood even when dealing with normal life stressors. The system turns on when needed and off when the challenge passes.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-emo-anh-mal (maladaptive anhedonia), phy-neu-rew-dys (reward deficit), and psy-mot-apa-mal (maladaptive apathy).
  academic_description: Studies show chronically elevated CRF in CSF and amygdala with CRF1 receptor upregulation in some regions and desensitization in others. Excessive CRF drives HPA dysregulation, noradrenergic hyperactivity, and dopamine hypofunction. Loss of NPY and oxytocin buffering capacity. CRF-induced reduction in dopamine creates anhedonia while CRF-enhanced stress memory consolidation strengthens drug-cue associations. This creates allostatic state where drug use temporarily normalizes CRF and restores hedonic tone.
  clinical_description: Patients experience persistent dysphoria, inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities, and overwhelming stress sensitivity. Minor stressors trigger intense craving and emotional distress. Assessment reveals elevated anxiety and depression scores with marked anhedonia. Treatment includes antidepressants targeting multiple systems, ketamine for rapid relief, and experimental CRF1 antagonists. Behavioral activation and pleasant event scheduling are essential.
  lay_description: Your brain's stress system is constantly sending distress signals, making you feel emotionally terrible even when nothing bad is happening.

  academic_description: Studies show hyperactive amygdala-hippocampal coupling during emotional memory formation with excessive CREB activation and protein synthesis. Reconsolidation becomes resistant to disruption, preventing memory updating. Overgeneralization occurs with emotional memories triggered by peripheral cues. Drug-cue memories show incubation, becoming stronger over time. Extinction memories fail to form or are rapidly forgotten. Stress enhances reconsolidation of drug memories while impairing extinction.
  clinical_description: Patients experience intrusive memories, flashbacks, and powerful cue-triggered cravings. Traumatic memories feel as vivid as when they occurred. Drug-associated places, people, and emotions trigger overwhelming urges to use. Assessment reveals PTSD symptoms and strong cue reactivity. Treatment includes propranolol during memory retrieval, EMDR, and intensive cue exposure therapy. Ketamine may help disrupt pathological memory circuits.
  lay_description: Your emotional memories are like broken records that keep playing the worst moments over and over.
