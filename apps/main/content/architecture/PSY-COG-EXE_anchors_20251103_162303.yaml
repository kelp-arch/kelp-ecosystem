  - Inhibitory control
  - Response suppression
  - Impulse control
  - Behavioral inhibition
  scope: Represents efficient suppression of prepotent responses and interruption of ongoing behaviors. Encompasses stop-signal performance, go/no-go accuracy, and the ability to override automatic reactions in favor of goal-appropriate responses.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the response inhibition component of executive control, focusing on the ability to suppress inappropriate actions and resist impulses that interfere with goal achievement.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as quick and accurate stopping ability, low commission errors, successful impulse control, and the capacity to interrupt drug-seeking behaviors when necessary.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-pfc-inh-reg (prefrontal inhibitory regulation), soc-fam-bou-lim-coh (cohesive family limits), and exi-mea-val-int-pur (purposeful value integration).
  academic_description: Intact response inhibition involves efficient prefrontal control over motor and cognitive responses, measured through stop-signal reaction time and go/no-go task performance. Research shows strong right inferior frontal gyrus activation during successful inhibition, with intact white matter connectivity between frontal control regions. Studies demonstrate that individuals with preserved inhibitory control show better treatment outcomes and lower relapse rates.
  clinical_description: Strong response inhibition allows clients to pause before acting on cravings or impulses. Assessment uses stop-signal and go/no-go tasks to measure stopping speed and accuracy. Interventions include inhibitory control training with progressively challenging stop-signal exercises, mindfulness practices emphasizing the pause between urge and action, and implementation intentions that pre-plan inhibitory responses to high-risk situations.
  lay_description: Having good impulse control means you can hit the brakes when needed - stopping yourself from doing something you'll regret, resisting that first impulse to use, or catching yourself before falling into old patterns. It's like having a reliable emergency brake that actually works when you need it most.

  synonyms:
  - Disinhibition
  - Poor impulse control

  scope: Represents deficient suppression of prepotent responses and inability to interrupt ongoing behaviors. Encompasses slow stop-signal reaction times, high commission errors on go/no-go tasks, and failure to override automatic reactions.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the response inhibition deficit within executive dysfunction, focusing on the inability to suppress inappropriate actions and resist impulses that undermine recovery goals.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as slow or failed stopping, frequent commission errors, poor impulse control, and inability to interrupt drug-seeking behaviors despite negative consequences.

  academic_description: Impaired response inhibition reflects compromised prefrontal control, evidenced by prolonged stop-signal reaction times and elevated commission errors. Neuroimaging reveals hypoactivation in right inferior frontal gyrus and pre-supplementary motor area during inhibition attempts. This deficit predicts higher relapse rates, with studies showing correlation between poor inhibitory control and treatment dropout.
  clinical_description: Weak response inhibition makes it extremely difficult to resist cravings or stop drug-seeking once initiated. Assessment reveals slow stopping speeds and frequent false alarms on inhibitory tasks. Treatment focuses on cognitive remediation through graduated inhibitory control training, external structure and accountability systems, and medications like naltrexone that reduce the urgency of impulses.
  lay_description: When your mental brakes don't work well, you act on impulses before thinking them through - grabbing that drink, making that call to your dealer, or saying yes when you meant to say no. It feels like watching yourself do things you don't want to do, unable to stop the momentum once it starts.
