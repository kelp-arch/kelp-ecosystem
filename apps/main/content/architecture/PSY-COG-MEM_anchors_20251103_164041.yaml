  academic_description: Intact working memory functioning per Baddeley's model shows preserved phonological loop (verbal rehearsal), visuospatial sketchpad (spatial processing), and central executive coordination. Complex span tasks reveal normal capacity (7±2 items) with effective updating, switching, and inhibition functions. N-back performance shows appropriate load-dependent activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Maintenance of recovery goals in working memory enables top-down regulation of subcortical craving responses.
  clinical_description: Assessment through digit span, spatial span, and n-back tasks reveals normal working memory capacity. Patients successfully hold recovery intentions active while navigating challenging situations. Interventions include prophylactic working memory training using adaptive n-back protocols, dual-task exercises combining memory with inhibition, and mindfulness practices that strengthen sustained attention. Strategy training teaches chunking, rehearsal, and visualization techniques.

  synonyms:
  - Working memory deficits
  - Reduced memory span
  - Executive memory impairment
  scope: Represents impaired working memory capacity with reduced ability to maintain and manipulate information, leading to difficulty holding recovery goals in mind and increased vulnerability to automatic drug-seeking behaviors.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the working memory component of memory processing, focusing on deficits in maintaining and manipulating information that compromise recovery-oriented decision-making.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as reduced span (4-5 items), poor dual-task performance, rapid loss of recovery intentions under cognitive load, and inability to override prepotent drug-seeking responses.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-pfc-dys through prefrontal dysfunction, soc-rel-sup-fra through forgetting social obligations, and exi-age-wis-dir through inability to hold broader perspectives.
  academic_description: Working memory impairments affect multiple components of Baddeley's model. Reduced phonological loop capacity limits verbal rehearsal to 4-5 items. Visuospatial sketchpad shows decreased precision. Central executive exhibits poor coordination, evidenced by disproportionate dual-task costs. N-back tasks reveal reduced accuracy at 2-back level with hypoactivation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These deficits predict relapse risk independent of other cognitive factors.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals reduced digit span (forward <6, backward <4), poor spatial span, and rapid performance degradation on n-back tasks. Patients lose track of recovery goals when stressed or distracted. Interventions include computerized working memory training with adaptive difficulty, external memory aids (notebooks, apps), and environmental modifications to reduce cognitive load. Pharmacological augmentation with modafinil or methylphenidate may enhance training effects.
  lay_description: Your mental workspace feels foggy and limited - like trying to juggle with too many balls. You forget what you were planning to do, lose track of conversations, and find your recovery goals slip from mind when you're stressed or tired, leaving you vulnerable to old habits.

  - Reduced implicit drug memory
  - Weakened automatic associations
  - Diminished drug priming
  scope: Represents weakened implicit drug-cue associations with development of new recovery-supportive automatic memories, reducing unconscious drug approach tendencies and supporting sustained abstinence.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the implicit memory component of memory processing, focusing on the automatic, unconscious associations that have been modified from drug-promoting to recovery-supporting patterns.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as reduced automatic approach to drug cues, positive implicit attitudes toward recovery activities, unconscious avoidance of risk situations, and automatic activation of coping responses.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-rew-reg through modified reward associations, exi-mea-val-pur through aligned implicit values, and soc-env-cue-coh through positive environmental associations.
  academic_description: Implicit memory modification shows weakened drug-cue associations measured through Implicit Association Tests (IAT) and evaluative priming tasks. Approach-avoidance tasks reveal automatic avoidance of drug stimuli. Semantic priming effects for drug words are reduced. Counter-conditioning has created competing recovery associations that interfere with drug memory expression. These implicit changes predict maintained abstinence beyond explicit motivation measures.
  clinical_description: Assessment via IAT shows faster association of drugs with negative concepts and recovery with positive concepts. Approach-avoidance tasks reveal automatic avoidance tendencies. Interventions include evaluative conditioning pairing drug cues with negative outcomes, approach-avoidance training pushing away drug images, and counter-conditioning creating incompatible associations. Mindfulness practices reduce automatic reactivity to residual associations.
  lay_description: Your brain's automatic pilot has been reprogrammed - drug cues no longer trigger that instant pull, and you find yourself naturally drawn toward healthy activities. These unconscious associations now work for your recovery rather than against it.
  core_components:
  - Weakened drug-reward links

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-rew-dys through hijacked reward associations, exi-mea-val-dir through misaligned implicit values, and soc-env-cue-fra through toxic environmental associations.
  academic_description: Strong implicit drug memories evident in fast drug-positive associations on IAT, showing 200-300ms faster responses than drug-negative pairings. Evaluative priming reveals automatic positive valence activation. Approach-avoidance tasks show reflexive approach tendencies requiring conscious override. Semantic networks show spreading activation from neutral to drug concepts. These implicit biases predict relapse independent of explicit attitudes.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals strong automatic drug-positive associations on IAT, reflexive approach on joystick tasks, and attentional capture by drug cues in dot-probe paradigms. Patients report acting on autopilot toward drug use. Interventions include intensive cognitive bias modification (500+ trials), prolonged approach-avoidance retraining, and competing response training. Pharmacological dampening with propranolol during retrieval may weaken associations.
  lay_description: Your brain has created powerful shortcuts linking drugs with relief, certain places with using, and specific feelings with craving. These associations operate like an autopilot you're not even aware of, pulling you toward drugs before your conscious mind can intervene.

  scope: Represents biased episodic memory with preferential recall of positive drug experiences while minimizing negative consequences, maintaining unrealistic appraisals that increase relapse vulnerability.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the episodic memory component of memory processing, focusing on recall biases that distort personal drug-related experiences and impair realistic decision-making about recovery.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as romanticized drug memories, fading affect for negative consequences, poor episodic future thinking about recovery, and fragmented autobiographical narratives.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-emo-reg-mal through emotional memory distortion, exi-tem-pre-dir through temporal myopia, and soc-ide-sel-fra through incoherent self-narrative.
  academic_description: Euphoric recall bias shows 2-3x stronger recall for positive versus negative drug experiences. Fading affect bias accelerates forgetting of negative consequences while preserving euphoric memories. Episodic future thinking is impoverished, generating fewer and less detailed recovery scenarios. Overgeneral memory style prevents specific consequence recall. These biases predict craving intensity and relapse risk.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals disproportionate recall of positive drug memories, minimization of consequences, and vague overgeneral memories when prompted for specifics. Patients struggle to generate detailed recovery futures. Interventions include structured consequence review with photographic evidence, memory reconsolidation protocols to update euphoric memories, and intensive episodic future thinking training. Cognitive restructuring challenges romanticized narratives.
  lay_description: Your memory plays tricks on you - the good times using seem vivid and appealing while the pain and consequences fade into a blur. You struggle to imagine a positive future without drugs, and your past use takes on a romanticized glow that doesn't match reality.
