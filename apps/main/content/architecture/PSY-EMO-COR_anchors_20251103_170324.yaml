  - Emotional balance
  - Hedonic flexibility
  - Affective equilibrium
  scope: Encompasses the capacity to experience both positive and negative emotions appropriately, with balanced hedonic tone allowing natural pleasure and appropriate negative affect signaling. Includes ability to discriminate emotional valence, experience reward from natural reinforcers, and maintain emotional coloring that matches life circumstances.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the valence dimension of core affect, focusing on the positive-negative axis of emotional experience and the capacity for appropriate hedonic tone.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as balanced emotional coloring with access to full range of positive and negative states, supporting both pleasure and protective negative emotions.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-rew-reg (regulated reward processing), soc-rel-int-coh (cohesive intimacy), and exi-mea-lif-pur (purposeful life meaning).
  academic_description: Adaptive valence processing reflects intact mesolimbic reward circuits and balanced monoamine function. Research shows preserved nucleus accumbens response to natural rewards, appropriate amygdala activation to negative stimuli, and flexible prefrontal modulation of affective responses. Circumplex model positions this as movement along the pleasantness-unpleasantness axis based on context.
  clinical_description: Assessment includes mood ratings, behavioral activation measures, and pleasure scale scores. Clients report ability to enjoy activities, appropriate sadness when warranted, and emotional responses matching situations. Interventions focus on behavioral activation, pleasant event scheduling, and savoring exercises to maintain hedonic balance.
  lay_description: You can feel genuinely happy when good things happen and appropriately sad when facing loss. Natural pleasures like time with loved ones, accomplishments, or simple enjoyments still bring satisfaction. Negative emotions serve as helpful signals rather than overwhelming states.

  scope: Encompasses persistent negative emotional bias, inability to experience pleasure from natural rewards, and dysregulated hedonic tone. Includes anhedonia, dysphoric baseline mood, loss of positive affect, and dominance of negative emotional states regardless of circumstances.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies dysfunction in the valence dimension of core affect, where the positive-negative axis becomes stuck in negative range with loss of hedonic capacity.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as persistent negative affect, inability to experience joy or satisfaction, and emotional responses skewed toward unpleasant regardless of context.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-rew-dys (dysregulated reward), soc-rel-int-fra (fragmented intimacy), and exi-mea-lif-dir (directionless life meaning).
  academic_description: Maladaptive valence reflects hypoactive mesolimbic reward circuits and monoamine dysfunction. Studies show blunted nucleus accumbens response to natural rewards, heightened amygdala negativity bias, and inflexible prefrontal-limbic coupling. Opponent process theory explains how substance use creates allostatic shift toward negative affective baseline.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals low scores on pleasure scales, persistent dysphoria on mood monitoring, and lack of response to previously enjoyable activities. Clients report feeling emotionally flat, unable to feel happiness, and stuck in negative states. Interventions include antidepressant medication, behavioral activation despite lack of pleasure, and gradual reward system rehabilitation.
  lay_description: Nothing feels good anymore - activities that once brought joy feel empty and meaningless. You might feel stuck in negativity, unable to experience happiness even when good things happen. Substances may be the only thing that temporarily lifts the emotional numbness.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-aut-sym-dys (dysregulated sympathetic), soc-beh-act-fra (fragmented activation), and exi-eng-apa-dir (directionless apathy).
  academic_description: Maladaptive arousal reflects autonomic dysregulation and impaired prefrontal modulation. Studies show chronic sympathetic dominance in hyperarousal or dorsal vagal shutdown in hypoarousal. Allostatic load from chronic stress creates inflexible arousal patterns. Sensitization and tolerance mechanisms alter arousal set points.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals chronic anxiety or emotional numbing on arousal scales. Clients report feeling constantly on edge or completely shut down, unable to calm down or activate appropriately. Interventions include anxiolytics for hyperarousal, activation strategies for hypoarousal, and window of tolerance work.
  lay_description: You might feel constantly anxious and unable to relax, or completely numb and unable to get motivated. Emotional intensity is either overwhelming or absent, never quite right for the situation. Substances might be used to artificially adjust this uncomfortable arousal state.

  academic_description: Maladaptive fear reflects amygdala hyperactivation or hypoactivation with impaired prefrontal regulation. Studies show overgeneralized fear conditioning, dysregulated HPA axis, and impaired fear extinction. Anxiety disorders involve false alarm responses while antisocial patterns show absent appropriate fear.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals excessive anxiety on fear scales, panic symptoms, or dangerous risk-taking. Clients experience debilitating worry, panic attacks limiting function, or reckless behavior from absent fear. Interventions include exposure therapy, anxiolytic medication, and cognitive restructuring of threat perception.
  lay_description: Fear might overwhelm you even when you're safe, creating constant anxiety and panic that limits your life. Or you might feel no fear when you should, leading to dangerous choices. Substances often become a way to manage overwhelming anxiety or create artificial fearlessness.

Clients report rage episodes damaging relationships, constant irritation, or inability to express anger. Interventions include anger management, mood stabilizers, and processing suppressed anger safely.
