  scope: Realistic confidence in one's ability to maintain complete abstinence from substances, characterized by balanced awareness of both capabilities and ongoing vulnerability.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the self-efficacy cluster's focus on capability beliefs by addressing confidence specifically related to maintaining abstinence from substance use.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as realistic confidence that acknowledges both strength and vulnerability, enabling sustained abstinence without overconfidence or despair.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with executive control (phy-neu-exc-reg), peer support utilization (soc-sup-pee-coh), and purposeful hope (exi-mea-hop-pur).
  academic_description: Abstinence self-efficacy represents beliefs about capability to maintain sobriety, predicting treatment retention and relapse rates better than motivation alone. Research shows optimal efficacy involves realistic confidence rather than overconfidence, with awareness of ongoing vulnerability preventing complacency. Bandura's theory emphasizes the role of mastery experiences in building abstinence efficacy through successful periods of sobriety.
  clinical_description: Assessment uses confidence ratings for maintaining abstinence across timeframes and situations. Building involves celebrating sobriety milestones while maintaining healthy respect for addiction's power. Interventions highlight past abstinence successes, develop contingency plans, and address abstinence violation effect. Overconfidence is tempered through discussion of ongoing vulnerability and need for continued vigilance.
  lay_description: This is believing you can stay clean and sober - not because it's easy, but because you've developed the strength and tools to do it. It means having confidence in your sobriety while staying aware that addiction requires ongoing attention. You believe 'I can do this' without thinking 'I've got this beat forever.'

  synonyms:
  - Abstinence helplessness
  - Sobriety despair
  - Recovery overconfidence
  scope: Dysfunctional beliefs about abstinence capability, manifesting as either learned helplessness about achieving sobriety or dangerous overconfidence that ignores relapse risks.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the self-efficacy cluster's maladaptive patterns by addressing distorted beliefs about abstinence capability that undermine recovery.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as either crushing helplessness that prevents attempts at sobriety or reckless overconfidence that leads to relapse through inadequate vigilance.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with executive dysfunction (phy-neu-exc-dys), peer support rejection (soc-sup-pee-fra), and directionless despair (exi-mea-hop-dir).
  academic_description: Maladaptive abstinence efficacy involves distorted capability beliefs that predict poor outcomes. Learned helplessness develops through repeated failed attempts, creating self-fulfilling prophecies of relapse. Conversely, unrealistic overconfidence ignores vulnerability, leading to inadequate relapse prevention. The abstinence violation effect demonstrates how efficacy collapse following a lapse precipitates full relapse through catastrophic thinking.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies patterns of defeatism or overconfidence through efficacy ratings and relapse history analysis. Learned helplessness requires cognitive restructuring of failure attributions and graduated success experiences. Overconfidence needs reality testing about ongoing vulnerability and development of humility. Both patterns benefit from balanced efficacy building that acknowledges both capabilities and limitations.
  lay_description: This is either believing you're doomed to fail at staying clean or thinking you're invincible and don't need to be careful anymore. Some people feel so defeated by past relapses that they don't even try. Others get overconfident and stop doing what keeps them sober. Both extremes set you up for failure.

  polarity_expression: Manifests as confidence to face and cope with difficult situations, enabling active engagement with life rather than avoidance of potential triggers.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with stress coping systems (phy-str-cop-reg), emotion regulation (psy-emo-reg-ada), and trigger management (soc-env-tri-coh).
  academic_description: Coping self-efficacy reflects beliefs about managing high-risk situations without substance use. Marlatt's relapse prevention model emphasizes situation-specific coping confidence as crucial for recovery. High coping efficacy enables approach coping and stress tolerance, while maintaining awareness of limits. Research shows coping efficacy mediates between skills training and outcomes, suggesting confidence activates learned capabilities.
  clinical_description: Assessment maps confidence across specific triggers and situations using tools like the Drug Taking Confidence Questionnaire. Building involves progressive exposure to manageable challenges, coping skills training, and stress inoculation. Interventions pair skill development with efficacy enhancement through practice and success experiences. Approach is encouraged over avoidance while respecting genuine limitations.
  lay_description: This is believing you can handle tough situations without using - dealing with stress, managing cravings, and facing triggers. It's not about avoiding all challenges but knowing you have tools to cope with them. You feel capable of handling what life throws at you without needing to escape through substances.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the self-efficacy cluster's maladaptive patterns through beliefs about coping inadequacy that perpetuate avoidance and vulnerability.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as overwhelming sense of coping inadequacy, driving avoidance patterns and creating self-fulfilling prophecies of being unable to handle challenges.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with stress dysregulation (phy-str-cop-dys), emotion dysregulation (psy-emo-reg-mal), and trigger fragmentation (soc-env-tri-fra).
  academic_description: Maladaptive coping efficacy involves beliefs about inability to manage challenges without substances. Low coping efficacy predicts avoidance coping, increased stress vulnerability, and relapse in high-risk situations. This creates vicious cycles where avoidance prevents skill development and efficacy building. Research shows coping helplessness maintains addiction through perceived need for substances to handle life.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals patterns of trigger avoidance and coping pessimism through situational confidence ratings. Treatment requires graduated exposure starting with least threatening situations, building coping skills incrementally, and processing success experiences. Avoidance is gently challenged while providing adequate support. Catastrophic predictions about coping inability need systematic testing.
  lay_description: This is feeling like you can't handle life's challenges without using substances. Every stressor, trigger, or difficult emotion feels overwhelming and impossible to face sober. This leads to avoiding situations, people, and feelings, making your world smaller and smaller while confirming your belief that you can't cope.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the self-efficacy cluster's maladaptive patterns through beliefs that recovery is limited to abstinence without life transformation.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as pervasive hopelessness about life improvement, creating self-imposed limitations on recovery potential and maintaining addiction identity.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with transformation resistance (exi-gro-tra-dir), identity fragmentation (soc-rol-rec-fra), and future pessimism (psy-cog-fut-mal).
  academic_description: Maladaptive recovery efficacy involves hopelessness about life reconstruction beyond abstinence. This 'dry drunk' phenomenon involves sobriety without broader life improvement. Research shows recovery hopelessness predicts poor quality of life even with abstinence maintenance. Limited recovery vision prevents identity transformation and maintains vulnerability through lack of meaningful life engagement.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals restricted recovery goals and life rebuilding pessimism through future projection exercises. Treatment involves exposure to diverse recovery stories, incremental goal achievement, and challenging limiting beliefs about potential. Hope therapy and recovery mentoring provide models of transformation. Identity work addresses internalized stigma and addiction-based self-concept.
  lay_description: This is believing that even if you get clean, your life won't really get better. You might stay sober but can't imagine having meaningful relationships, achieving goals, or being happy. Recovery feels like deprivation rather than opportunity. This hopelessness keeps you stuck even when abstinent.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with cognitive appraisal (psy-cog-app-ada), context processing (phy-neu-ctx-reg), and setting management (soc-env-set-coh).
  academic_description: Situational confidence reflects the context-dependent nature of self-efficacy. Bandura emphasized efficacy as situation-specific rather than global trait. Research shows accurate discrimination of confidence across situations predicts better outcomes than uniformly high or low efficacy. This enables strategic planning, appropriate support-seeking, and targeted skill development for specific vulnerabilities.
  clinical_description: Assessment maps confidence across diverse situations using tools examining various triggers, emotions, and social contexts. Building involves situation-specific skills training, creating detailed confidence hierarchies, and developing context-appropriate strategies. High-confidence situations become resources while low-confidence contexts receive focused intervention. Reality testing ensures accuracy of situational assessments.
  lay_description: This is knowing that your confidence varies depending on the situation - you might feel strong refusing drugs from strangers but vulnerable when lonely at home.

  polarity_expression: Manifests as either global helplessness that ignores situational strengths or dangerous blind spots that miss specific vulnerabilities.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with appraisal distortion (psy-cog-app-mal), context dysregulation (phy-neu-ctx-dys), and setting fragmentation (soc-env-set-fra).
  academic_description: Maladaptive situational confidence involves failure to discriminate efficacy across contexts. Global low efficacy creates pervasive helplessness ignoring situational strengths. Conversely, failure to recognize context-specific vulnerabilities creates blind spots leading to unexpected relapses. Research shows poor situational discrimination predicts relapse through inadequate preparation or inappropriate risk-taking.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals patterns of overgeneralization or blind spots through detailed situational analysis and relapse history review. Treatment involves systematic confidence mapping, reality testing of global beliefs, and identification of unrecognized vulnerabilities. Cognitive restructuring addresses all-or-nothing thinking about capabilities. Behavioral experiments test situation-specific predictions.
  lay_description: This is either feeling helpless in all situations (missing your strengths) or not recognizing specific danger zones (missing your vulnerabilities). Some people think they can't handle anything, while others don't see their weak spots. Both lead to problems - either giving up everywhere or walking into traps unprepared.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with attribution processes (psy-cog-att-ada), learning systems (phy-neu-lea-reg), and feedback reception (soc-sup-fee-coh).
  academic_description: Adaptive source processing involves effectively utilizing Bandura's four efficacy sources. Mastery experiences are recognized and internalized. Vicarious learning from similar others builds confidence. Verbal persuasion from credible sources is accepted. Physiological arousal is accurately interpreted. Research shows individuals differ in ability to process these sources, with effective processing predicting efficacy growth and recovery outcomes.
  clinical_description: Assessment examines how clients process success experiences, peer examples, encouragement, and body signals. Interventions enhance source utilization through success journaling, structured peer modeling, feedback training, and arousal reinterpretation. Cognitive biases that dismiss positive information are identified and challenged. Clients learn to actively seek and process efficacy-building experiences.
  lay_description: This is the ability to build confidence from different sources - learning from your successes, being inspired by others' recovery, accepting encouragement, and reading your body's signals accurately. You notice when you do well, learn from others like you, believe supportive feedback, and understand that nervousness doesn't mean inability.

  polarity_expression: Manifests as systematic rejection or distortion of efficacy-building experiences, maintaining low confidence despite contradictory evidence.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with attribution distortion (psy-cog-att-mal), learning dysfunction (phy-neu-lea-dys), and feedback rejection (soc-sup-fee-fra).
  academic_description: Maladaptive source processing involves systematic dismissal of efficacy information. Success is attributed to luck, peer models are seen as different, encouragement is deflected, and arousal confirms inability. This creates efficacy-resistant patterns where positive experiences fail to build confidence. Research shows depressive attributional styles and negative cognitive biases interfere with efficacy development.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies patterns of success discounting, model rejection, encouragement deflection, and arousal catastrophizing. Treatment involves attribution retraining, cognitive restructuring of filtering biases, and behavioral experiments to test dismissal patterns. Mindfulness helps notice dismissed information. Group therapy provides repeated exposure to encouragement and modeling opportunities.
  lay_description: This is the inability to build confidence even when things go well. You explain away successes as luck, think others who recover are different from you, reject encouragement as false, and see nervousness as proof you can't do something. No matter what happens, your confidence stays low because you dismiss or twist the evidence.

  academic_description: Collective efficacy extends individual efficacy to group capability beliefs. In recovery, this involves confidence in the community's power to support sobriety and transformation. Research shows collective efficacy predicts treatment engagement, mutual aid participation, and sustained recovery. Group identification and perceived similarity enhance collective efficacy. This provides additional motivational resources beyond individual confidence.
  clinical_description: Assessment examines beliefs about group recovery power and willingness to engage community support. Building involves group therapy participation, sponsor relationships, and recovery community involvement. Interventions highlight collective success stories, facilitate group bonding, and encourage service to others. Resistance to group help is explored while respecting individual preferences.
  lay_description: This is believing in the power of recovery communities and knowing you're part of something bigger. You trust that together, people in recovery can achieve what seems impossible alone.

  polarity_expression: Manifests as isolation from group recovery power, either through individual grandiosity or collective hopelessness about community recovery potential.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with mutual aid rejection (soc-sup-mut-fra), community disconnection (soc-com-rec-fra), and belonging absence (exi-con-bel-dir).
  academic_description: Maladaptive collective efficacy involves disconnection from group recovery resources. This includes disbelief in community recovery power, terminal uniqueness preventing identification, or collective pessimism about group capability. Research shows isolation from collective efficacy predicts poor outcomes through loss of social reinforcement and modeling opportunities. Stigma and shame often drive disconnection from recovery communities.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals patterns of group rejection, terminal uniqueness, and collective pessimism through social history and treatment engagement. Interventions address barriers to group participation including social anxiety, trust issues, and uniqueness beliefs. Graduated exposure to recovery communities, starting with low-threat options, builds comfort. Individual therapy explores resistance while maintaining respect for autonomy.
  lay_description: This is cutting yourself off from the power of recovery communities - either thinking you're too different to benefit from group support or believing recovery communities can't really help anyone. You might think 'groups don't work' or 'I'm not like those people.' This isolation removes a powerful source of strength and hope.
