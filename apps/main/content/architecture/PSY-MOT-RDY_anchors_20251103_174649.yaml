  - Appropriate problem recognition
  - Productive contemplation
  - Openness to feedback
  scope: Adaptive recognition of need for change and productive exploration of ambivalence in early stages. Includes appropriate consciousness raising, accurate problem recognition, and openness to considering change when warranted.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the early stage processes (precontemplation and contemplation) within the temporal progression through motivational states, focusing on adaptive problem recognition and ambivalence exploration.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as appropriate openness to feedback, accurate problem recognition, and productive exploration of ambivalence that facilitates forward movement through early change stages.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with executive recognition processes (phy-neu-exc-reg), family problem recognition (soc-fam-bnd-coh), and awareness cultivation (exi-awa-prs-pur).
  academic_description: Adaptive recognition involves appropriate consciousness raising and environmental reevaluation processes characteristic of early TTM stages. Research shows that individuals who accurately recognize problems and productively explore ambivalence are more likely to progress to preparation. Decisional balance begins shifting as cons of current behavior become salient. Self-reevaluation processes activate as individuals consider how change aligns with personal values.
  clinical_description: Assessment focuses on problem recognition scales and contemplation ladders. Interventions include motivational interviewing to develop discrepancy, personalized feedback about consequences, and values clarification exercises. Clinicians avoid pushing for action, instead facilitating exploration of ambivalence through decisional balance exercises. Psychoeducation provides information without prescribing change.
  lay_description: This is when you start to see that something might need to change and begin thinking about it seriously. You're open to learning about the problem and considering whether change would be worthwhile, without feeling pressured to act before you're ready.

  synonyms:
  - Denial and resistance
  - Chronic contemplation
  - Recognition avoidance
  scope: Maladaptive patterns of denial, minimization, or chronic contemplation without progression. Includes resistance to feedback, rationalization of problems, and getting stuck in endless ambivalence without movement toward change.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the maladaptive early stage processes within temporal progression, focusing on patterns that prevent appropriate movement through precontemplation and contemplation stages.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as denial of obvious problems, resistance to feedback, rationalization, or chronic contemplation that prevents progression to preparation and action stages.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with executive dysfunction (phy-neu-exc-dys), family denial patterns (soc-fam-bnd-fra), and existential avoidance (exi-awa-prs-dir).
  academic_description: Maladaptive recognition involves either complete denial characteristic of resistant precontemplation or chronic contemplation without progression. Research identifies 'rebellious,' 'resigned,' and 'rationalizing' precontemplation subtypes. Chronic contemplators show behavioral procrastination and decisional balance that remains static. Defense mechanisms prevent consciousness raising, maintaining homeostatic problem behaviors.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals low problem recognition scores or extended time in contemplation (>6 months). Interventions address resistance through rolling with resistance techniques, exploring discrepancy gently, and addressing underlying fears about change. For chronic contemplators, interventions include setting contemplation deadlines, behavioral experiments, and addressing perfectionism or fear of failure.
  lay_description: This is either refusing to see a problem that others clearly recognize, or getting stuck endlessly thinking about change without ever moving forward. You might make excuses, blame others, or spend months or years 'thinking about' change without taking steps.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the preparation stage within temporal progression, focusing on adaptive commitment formation and planning processes that bridge contemplation and action.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as concrete goal-setting, effective planning, resource gathering, and strong commitment that facilitates successful transition to and maintenance of action.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with executive planning (psy-cog-pln-ada), goal formation (exi-mea-gol-pur), and social commitment (soc-rel-com-coh).
  academic_description: Adaptive commitment involves self-liberation processes where individuals believe in their ability to change and make firm commitments. Research shows that public commitment, concrete planning, and identifying specific start dates predict successful action. Preparation stage individuals show decisional balance favoring change and increasing self-efficacy. Commitment strength correlates with action maintenance.
  clinical_description: Assessment includes commitment strength scales and preparation checklists. Interventions focus on developing specific action plans, identifying and securing resources, establishing accountability, and making public commitments. Clinicians help identify potential barriers and develop contingency plans. Commitment enhancement techniques strengthen resolve.
  lay_description: This is when you move from thinking about change to actively preparing for it. You make concrete plans, tell others about your intentions, set a start date, and gather the resources and support you'll need to succeed.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies maladaptive preparation stage patterns within temporal progression, focusing on commitment problems that prevent successful action initiation.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as vague intentions without concrete plans, avoidance of public commitment, inadequate preparation, or ambivalent commitment that predicts action failure.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with planning deficits (psy-cog-pln-mal), goal confusion (exi-mea-gol-dir), and commitment phobia (soc-rel-com-fra).
  academic_description: Maladaptive commitment involves insufficient preparation or commitment ambivalence. Research shows that vague intentions, private-only commitments, and inadequate resource preparation predict early action failure. Some individuals skip preparation entirely, attempting action without planning. Others remain in pseudo-preparation, making repeated plans without implementation.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals vague goals, absent timelines, or repeated plan revisions without action. Interventions address commitment fears, perfectionism, and resource barriers. Clinicians may need to return to contemplation work if ambivalence remains high. For those skipping preparation, interventions emphasize the importance of planning before action.
  lay_description: This is making half-hearted plans or avoiding real commitment to change. You might keep your plans secret, stay vague about when you'll start, or jump into action without proper preparation, setting yourself up for failure.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies maladaptive action stage patterns within temporal progression, focusing on implementation problems that prevent successful behavior change.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as inconsistent behavior attempts, poor coping with challenges, unchanged environmental triggers, and early discontinuation that depletes motivation and reinforces failure expectations.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with behavioral dysregulation (psy-beh-hbt-mal), coping failure (phy-str-cop-dys), and directionless action (exi-age-act-dir).
  academic_description: Maladaptive action involves premature attempts without adequate preparation, inconsistent implementation, or early discontinuation. Research shows that action without prior contemplation and preparation has high failure rates. Insufficient coping strategies and unchanged environments predict relapse. Repeated action failures create learned helplessness.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals inconsistent behavior patterns and inadequate coping. Interventions may require returning to preparation stage for better planning. Clinicians address skill deficits, environmental barriers, and demoralization from failures. Harm reduction approaches may be appropriate for those unable to sustain full action.
  lay_description: This is trying to change without being truly ready, or starting strong but quickly falling back into old patterns. You might lack the skills or support needed, or give up when things get difficult, reinforcing beliefs that change is impossible.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with habit instability (psy-beh-hbt-mal), stress vulnerability (phy-str-res-dys), and directionless maintenance (exi-gro-res-dir).
  academic_description: Maladaptive maintenance involves either high relapse vulnerability or rigid overcontrol. Research identifies complacency, lifestyle imbalance, and inadequate relapse prevention as risk factors. Some individuals maintain through white-knuckling without identity integration. Others show abstinence violation effect after minor lapses. Lack of continued growth motivation predicts eventual relapse.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals relapse warning signs or quality of life problems from rigidity. Interventions address specific vulnerabilities through enhanced relapse prevention, lifestyle rebalancing, or flexibility training. Clinicians help process lapses without catastrophizing. For rigid maintainers, focus on flexibility and life enjoyment.
  lay_description: This is either being constantly at risk of falling back into old patterns, or maintaining change through rigid rules that make life joyless. You might become complacent about risks, or so controlling that you can't adapt to life's changes.
