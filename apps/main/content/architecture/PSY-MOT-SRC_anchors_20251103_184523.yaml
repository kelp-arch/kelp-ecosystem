  academic_description: Autonomy need satisfaction represents volitional engagement and psychological freedom in Self-Determination Theory. Research shows autonomy support predicts better treatment outcomes through enhanced intrinsic motivation and internalization. Autonomy involves acting from one's authentic self rather than from external or internal pressures. Studies demonstrate that autonomy-supportive environments facilitate lasting behavior change through genuine self-endorsement.
  clinical_description: Assessment includes measures of perceived choice and volition in treatment. Interventions focus on offering meaningful choices, acknowledging client perspectives, and minimizing controlling language. Clinicians provide rationales for suggestions, explore client values, and support self-initiated changes. Autonomy support involves collaborative treatment planning and respecting client decisions even when disagreeing.
  lay_description: You feel like recovery is your choice, not something forced on you. You make decisions based on what matters to you personally, not just to please others or avoid consequences. There's a sense of freedom in your recovery journey - you're doing it because you want to, not because you have to.

  synonyms:
  - External regulation stuck
  - Introjection fixation
  - Integration failure
  scope: Maladaptive blocking of the internalization process, remaining stuck in external or introjected regulation. The individual maintains compliance-based or guilt-driven motivation without developing genuine ownership or value integration.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies blocked internalization within motivational source, representing failure to develop autonomous regulation from external motivations.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as persistent external compliance, guilt or shame-driven behavior, absence of value integration, and maintained external locus of control.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with identity confusion (psy-ide-rec-mal), value conflicts (exi-mea-val-dir), and role compliance (soc-rol-rec-fra).
  academic_description: Blocked internalization occurs when individuals remain in external or introjected regulation without progressing toward integration. Research shows that controlling environments, unresolved ambivalence, and value conflicts prevent internalization. Persistent external regulation leads to unstable motivation dependent on continued external contingencies. Introjection creates internal pressure without genuine self-endorsement, maintaining vulnerability to relapse.
  clinical_description: Assessment reveals external locus of control and absence of personal investment. Clients show compliance without ownership or are driven by guilt and shame. Interventions explore resistance, address shame-based motivations, and search for personal relevance. Treatment focuses on resolving ambivalence and finding authentic reasons for change beyond external pressure.
  lay_description: You're going through the motions of recovery because you have to, not because you want to. It might be to avoid consequences, please others, or because you feel guilty when you don't. The motivation never feels like it's really coming from you - it's always about external pressure or internal guilt.
