  scope: Represents adaptive persistence with ability to maintain effort toward recovery goals despite setbacks. Includes frustration tolerance, determination, and flexible perseverance that sustains long-term recovery efforts.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the persistence temperament dimension as sustained effort capacity that enables continued recovery work through challenges while maintaining flexibility.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as determined recovery engagement with ability to persist through difficulties while adapting strategies when needed.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-exe-wkm-reg (sustained executive function), soc-rol-fam-coh (family role persistence), and exi-gro-res-pur (purposeful resilience).
  academic_description: High persistence predicts successful recovery through maintained effort despite obstacles. Research shows persistent individuals demonstrate better treatment retention, homework compliance, and long-term abstinence. Associated with grit and growth mindset in recovery context.
  clinical_description: TCI persistence scores above 50 indicate adaptive determination. Clients maintain treatment engagement through setbacks and demonstrate frustration tolerance. Interventions reinforce persistence while preventing rigid perseveration. Recovery emphasizes long-term goal pursuit.
  lay_description: You keep working toward recovery even when it gets difficult, not giving up when you face setbacks. This determination helps you push through challenges while being flexible enough to try new approaches when needed.
  core_components:
  - Sustained effort
  - Frustration tolerance
  - Goal commitment
  - Flexible determination
  associated_processes:
  - Setback recovery
  - Effort maintenance
  - Challenge engagement

  synonyms:
  - Low persistence
  - Quick surrender
  - Frustration intolerance
  - Goal abandonment
  scope: Represents maladaptive low persistence characterized by quick abandonment of recovery efforts when facing obstacles. Includes frustration intolerance, easy discouragement, and inability to sustain effort through challenges.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the persistence temperament dimension as insufficient effort capacity that prevents sustained recovery work, leading to repeated treatment dropout and relapse.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as quick abandonment of recovery attempts when facing difficulties, with inability to tolerate frustration or maintain long-term effort.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-exe-wkm-dys (executive dysfunction), soc-rol-fam-fra (role abandonment), and exi-gro-res-dir (directionless surrender).
  academic_description: Low persistence predicts poor recovery outcomes through premature treatment termination and goal abandonment. Research shows association with relapse following initial setbacks, treatment dropout, and failure to maintain behavior change. Linked to learned helplessness patterns.
  clinical_description: TCI persistence scores below 40 indicate problematic frustration intolerance. Clients abandon treatment after setbacks and demonstrate learned helplessness. Treatment requires graduated success experiences, frustration tolerance training, and intensive support through challenges.
  lay_description: You tend to give up quickly when recovery gets hard, feeling overwhelmed by setbacks that others might push through. This pattern of quitting when frustrated makes it difficult to achieve lasting change.
  core_components:
  - Low frustration tolerance
  - Quick discouragement
  - Effort abandonment
  - Goal surrender
  associated_processes:
  - Premature quitting
  - Setback catastrophizing
  - Learned helplessness
  - Motivation collapse
