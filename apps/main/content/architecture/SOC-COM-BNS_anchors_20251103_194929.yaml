  - Housing scarcity
  - Inadequate recovery residences
  - Limited sober living options
  scope: Represents communities with insufficient recovery housing, long waitlists for any placement, limited housing models that don't match diverse needs, lack of quality oversight leading to exploitative or unsafe conditions, and unaffordable options that exclude those without resources. Characterized by housing instability, frequent moves, and returns to homelessness.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the housing component of basic needs services in dysfunction, showing how inadequate recovery housing infrastructure creates residential instability that undermines recovery efforts and perpetuates cycles of relapse and homelessness.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as fragmented housing systems with months-long waitlists, only one or two housing types available, predatory sober homes without oversight, and costs that exclude those most in need of stable housing.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-exe-pln-mal (impaired housing planning), phy-neu-str-dys (chronic housing stress), exi-mea-hom-dir (homelessness and rootlessness), and soc-ins-hou-fra (failed institutional housing).
  academic_description: Research reveals how housing instability significantly increases relapse risk and treatment dropout. Studies show that communities with inadequate recovery housing have 40% higher rates of return to use within 90 days of treatment. Investigations of unregulated sober homes document exploitation, unsafe conditions, and trauma that worsen addiction. Homelessness research demonstrates the revolving door between streets, jails, hospitals, and brief treatment episodes without stable housing. Economic analysis shows how housing scarcity increases overall system costs through repeated crisis interventions.
  clinical_description: Clinical work involves crisis management around housing instability, advocating with limited resources, and managing client frustration with long waitlists. Clinicians document housing barriers, track days homeless, and coordinate emergency shelter placements. They manage safety concerns in substandard housing, address trauma from exploitative sober homes, and support clients through frequent relocations. Interventions include homeless outreach, shelter liaison work, and temporary housing negotiations while maintaining therapeutic relationships despite residential instability.
  lay_description: Communities with poor recovery housing leave people cycling between homelessness, shelters, and brief stays in treatment. Long waitlists mean people lose motivation while waiting for placement. The few available options may be overcrowded, poorly managed, or exploitative 'flophouses' that take advantage of vulnerable people. High costs exclude those without family support or savings. People end up on the streets, in abandoned buildings, or returning to dangerous living situations that trigger relapse.
  structural_components: Overwhelmed shelter systems, long housing waitlists, unregulated sober homes, absent certification programs, no housing vouchers, hostile zoning laws, and NIMBY opposition to recovery residences.
  social_processes: Housing discrimination against people in recovery, neighborhood opposition to sober living homes, exploitation by predatory housing operators, social isolation from residential instability, and stigma preventing housing development.
  societal_relevance: Inadequate recovery housing perpetuates visible homelessness, increases neighborhood disorder, overwhelms emergency services, and reinforces stigma about recovery. It reflects community failure to provide basic shelter and perpetuates marginalization of people with addiction.
