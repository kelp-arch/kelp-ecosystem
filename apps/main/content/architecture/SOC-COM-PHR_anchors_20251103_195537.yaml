  academic_description: Research shows ineffective programs like DARE and scared straight approaches can actually increase substance use. Schools without evidence-based prevention show 40-60% higher initiation rates and earlier onset of use compared to those with quality programs.
  clinical_description: Absence of school prevention increases clinical burden through earlier onset, more severe presentations, and missed early intervention opportunities. Punitive approaches drive underground use and delay help-seeking, complicating treatment when youth finally present.
  lay_description: When schools only punish drug use without teaching prevention skills, or use outdated scare tactics, kids don't learn how to handle real situations. Zero-tolerance policies push problems underground and miss chances to help kids early.

  academic_description: Communities without SSPs experience HIV outbreaks costing millions in treatment. Scott County, Indiana's 2015 outbreak infected 235 people in a county of 24,000, demonstrating consequences of SSP prohibition. Areas without SSPs show 8-10 times higher HIV/HCV rates.
  clinical_description: SSP absence forces clinicians to treat preventable infections including endocarditis, abscesses, and bloodborne diseases. Prohibition drives underground needle sharing, delays medical care, and results in advanced disease presentation requiring intensive intervention.
  lay_description: When communities ban needle exchanges, people share needles spreading HIV and hepatitis. Police arrests at exchange sites drive people underground, and community fears about enabling use prevent life-saving services that actually help people get treatment.
