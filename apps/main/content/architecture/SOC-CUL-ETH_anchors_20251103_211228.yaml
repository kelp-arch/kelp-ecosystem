  scope: Breakdown of ethnic community bonds and support systems. Includes social isolation from ethnic group, weak community organizations, absent mutual aid, intergenerational disconnection, community conflict, and lack of collective resources for addressing problems.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the ethnic-racial dynamics cluster's fragmentation dimension by examining how ethnic community breakdown creates vulnerability to addiction through lost social support, absent monitoring, and missing collective resources.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as fragmented community structure through weak organizations, isolated individuals, absent mutual aid, resource scarcity, and inability to mobilize collectively for member needs.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with soc-com-cap-fra (social capital loss), soc-soc-iso-fra (social isolation), and psy-soc-con-mal (social disconnection) in how community fragmentation removes critical support structures.
  academic_description: Research links ethnic community fragmentation to increased substance use risk. Geographic dispersion weakens ethnic networks. Assimilation pressure fragments communities. Intergenerational conflict disrupts transmission of protective factors. Weak community organizations cannot provide support or monitoring. Individual isolation from ethnic community removes cultural protective factors. Community conflict depletes collective resources. Absence of ethnic density eliminates enclave benefits. Social disorganization theory explains how community breakdown enables deviance.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies community disconnection, isolation, and resource absence. Interventions address fragmentation through reconnection efforts, network building, and community development. Treatment may need to create surrogate community through group therapy or peer support when natural community is absent. Recovery involves careful community building, conflict resolution where needed, and gradual reconnection. Advocacy addresses structural factors fragmenting communities.
  lay_description: When your ethnic community has fallen apart - people scattered and disconnected, cultural organizations weak or gone, no one looking out for each other, generations not talking, and everyone struggling alone. Without community support and connection, people are more vulnerable to substance problems with nowhere to turn for help.
