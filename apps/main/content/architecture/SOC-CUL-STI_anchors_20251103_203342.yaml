  scope: Represents societal attitudes of prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion toward people with addiction, characterized by stereotyping, labeling, social distance preferences, and discriminatory behaviors.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the public stigma dimension of stigma systems by focusing on collective societal attitudes and behaviors that promote discrimination and exclusion.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as social rejection through stereotyping, dehumanizing language, social distance preferences, employment discrimination, housing restrictions, and support for punitive rather than therapeutic responses.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-soc-sha-mal (pathological shame), exi-mea-ide-dir (directionless identity), and soc-ins-jus-fra (punitive justice systems).
  academic_description: Research shows public stigma creates significant barriers to treatment access, with studies indicating that fear of discrimination prevents 40% of individuals from seeking help. Stereotypes portraying addiction as moral weakness or character flaw persist despite scientific evidence. Social distance preferences lead to employment discrimination, with employers less likely to hire individuals with addiction histories.
  clinical_description: Clinical practice addresses public stigmatization through anti-stigma campaigns, protest against discriminatory portrayals, education about addiction neuroscience, advocacy for policy changes, and strategic disclosure planning with clients to manage stigma exposure. Clinicians help clients develop stigma resistance strategies and coping mechanisms for discrimination.
  lay_description: When society sees addiction as a moral failing or character flaw, people face judgment, name-calling, and exclusion. This includes losing jobs, being denied housing, losing friends, and being treated as dangerous or untrustworthy. Such rejection makes people hide their struggles and avoid seeking help.
  structural_components:
  - Discriminatory policies
  - Media stereotypes

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the self-stigma dimension of stigma systems by focusing on how individuals internalize and apply negative stereotypes to themselves.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as self-stigmatization through shame, self-blame, low self-esteem, treatment avoidance, social withdrawal, self-isolation, and resignation to stereotypes.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-bel-mal (maladaptive beliefs), psy-emo-sha-mal (toxic shame), and exi-mea-wor-dir (directionless self-worth).
  academic_description: Research shows self-stigma predicts treatment avoidance, with internalized shame being the strongest barrier to help-seeking. The 'why try?' effect describes how internalized stereotypes lead to behavioral confirmation through reduced self-efficacy. Studies indicate self-stigma correlates with increased depression, reduced quality of life, and poorer treatment outcomes.
  clinical_description: Clinical interventions address self-stigmatization through specialized programs targeting internalized stigma, cognitive therapy challenging negative self-beliefs, acceptance and commitment therapy for shame, group interventions normalizing experiences, and psychoeducation about stigma processes. Clinicians assess internalized stigma levels and its impact on treatment engagement.
  lay_description: Self-stigmatization happens when people believe society's negative messages about addiction apply to them. They feel deep shame, blame themselves, believe they're weak or worthless, and may give up trying to change. This internal judgment often feels worse than external discrimination.
  structural_components:
  - Internalized narratives
  - Shame systems
  - Identity structures
  social_processes:
  - Stereotype internalization
  - Self-fulfilling prophecy
  - Social comparison
  societal_relevance: Self-stigmatization prevents help-seeking, maintains addiction cycles, increases mental health comorbidity, and perpetuates social exclusion through self-isolation.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with soc-ins-hea-fra (discriminatory healthcare), soc-ins-emp-fra (employment barriers), and soc-ins-jus-fra (punitive justice).
  academic_description: Research shows structural discrimination creates profound barriers to recovery. Insurance limitations result in 60% of people needing treatment not receiving it. Criminal records create lifetime employment barriers. Housing discrimination forces people into unstable situations that trigger relapse. Punitive policies increase recidivism compared to treatment approaches.
  clinical_description: Clinical practice addresses structural discrimination through documentation of systemic barriers, advocacy for individual clients, collaboration with legal services, education about rights and protections, and participation in policy reform efforts. Clinicians help clients develop strategies to navigate discriminatory systems while working toward systemic change.
  lay_description: Structural discrimination means the system is stacked against people with addiction - insurance won't cover treatment adequately, criminal records block employment, landlords refuse housing, and minor offenses lead to incarceration instead of help. These barriers make recovery nearly impossible.
  structural_components:
  - Discriminatory policies
  - Institutional barriers
  - Systemic exclusion
  social_processes:
