  - Attachment disorganization
  scope: Encompasses insecure attachment patterns including anxious (preoccupied), avoidant (dismissing), and disorganized styles characterized by incoherent working models, rigid strategies, and emotional dysregulation increasing addiction vulnerability.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the attachment systems cluster by focusing on disorganized attachment patterns that create vulnerability to addiction through impaired emotional regulation.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as fragmented, incoherent attachment strategies with conflicting or rigid approaches to relationships and self-regulation.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-emo-reg-mal (maladaptive regulation), phy-str-cor-dys (dysregulated stress), and exi-mea-con-dir (directionless connection).
  academic_description: Insecure attachment affects 40% of populations through three patterns. Anxious attachment involves hyperactivating strategies, emotional flooding, and desperate proximity-seeking. Avoidant attachment uses deactivating strategies, emotional suppression, and compulsive self-reliance. Disorganized attachment shows contradictory behaviors, approach-avoidance conflicts, and dissociative responses. Each pattern increases addiction risk through different self-medication pathways.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies specific insecure patterns and their defensive strategies. Treatment includes attachment-based therapy, EMDR for attachment trauma, and mentalization-based approaches. Focus on recognizing patterns, processing attachment injuries, and developing earned security through therapeutic relationship.
  lay_description: Insecure attachment develops when caregiving is inconsistent, rejecting, or frightening. Anxiously attached people cling desperately and use substances to manage overwhelming emotions. Avoidantly attached people stay distant and use substances to maintain numbness. Disorganized attachment creates chaos managed through substance use.
  structural_components: Incoherent representations, conflicting models, rigid or chaotic strategies

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-att-mal (maladaptive attention), soc-com-exp-fra (fragmented expression), and phy-aut-hrv-dys (dysregulated HRV).
  academic_description: Emotional unavailability results from parental depression, substance abuse, preoccupation, or attachment avoidance. Children experience emotional neglect despite physical presence. Unavailable caregivers miss emotional cues, fail to provide contingent responses, and leave children without co-regulation support. This forces premature self-regulation, often through substance use.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies patterns of withdrawal, missed cues, and emotional absence. Treatment addresses underlying causes (depression, addiction, trauma) while building availability skills. Interventions include parent sensitivity training, video feedback, and addressing barriers to emotional presence.
  lay_description: Emotionally unavailable family members may be physically present but emotionally absent. They miss emotional cues, don't respond to needs, and seem preoccupied or withdrawn. Children learn to self-soothe, often through substances, when emotional support isn't available.

  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the attachment systems cluster by focusing on misattunement that prevents co-regulation and increases addiction risk through regulatory failures.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as out-of-sync interactions, misread emotions, non-contingent responses, and amplification of distress.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-aut-syn-dys (dysregulated synchrony), psy-soc-emp-mal (maladaptive empathy), and exi-rel-res-dir (directionless resonance).
  academic_description: Misattunement occurs through intrusive overstimulation, withdrawn understimulation, or mismatched affect. Parents may misread cues, respond non-contingently, or impose their emotional states. This creates regulatory chaos, teaching children that relationships don't provide regulation, driving them toward substances for predictable relief.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies patterns of misreading, mistiming, and mismatching in interactions. Treatment includes attunement training, reflective functioning therapy, and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. Focus on improving cue reading, timing responses, and matching regulatory needs.
  lay_description: Misattuned families are emotionally out of sync. They misread feelings, respond at wrong times or in wrong ways, and may make emotional situations worse instead of better. This teaches children to seek predictable relief through substances rather than unpredictable relationships.
  structural_components: Asynchronous patterns, non-contingent responses, mismatched affect

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-str-cor-dys (dysregulated cortisol), psy-tra-saf-mal (maladaptive safety), and exi-tru-fai-dir (directionless faith).
  academic_description: Betrayal trauma occurs when dependents are harmed by those they rely on for survival. This creates impossible bind between attachment and self-protection. Children develop hypervigilance, dissociation, and self-protective strategies. Complex trauma from attachment figures profoundly disrupts development, creating vulnerability to addiction as self-medication.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies betrayal trauma, safety violations, and protective strategies. Treatment includes trauma-focused therapy, safety stabilization, and trust repair work. Focus on establishing safety, processing betrayal, and carefully rebuilding trust capacity.
  lay_description: When families become sources of danger rather than safety, children learn to protect themselves through hypervigilance or emotional numbing. Without trustworthy protection, substances may seem like the only reliable source of safety and relief.
  structural_components: Unpredictable threat, absent protection, betrayal patterns

  - Pathological individuation
  - Fusion or isolation
  - Boundary dysfunction
  scope: Encompasses enmeshed fusion or emotional cutoff patterns, including poor differentiation, rigid proximity patterns, and identity confusion that drives substance use for pseudo-independence.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the attachment systems cluster by focusing on individuation failures that create unhealthy dependence or isolation increasing addiction risk.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as enmeshed clinging or complete cutoff, poor boundaries, and undifferentiated or isolated self.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-dev-aut-mal (maladaptive autonomy), soc-fam-bou-fra (fragmented boundaries), and exi-ide-ind-dir (directionless individuation).
  academic_description: Pathological individuation presents as two extremes. Enmeshment involves emotional fusion, poor boundaries, and inability to tolerate separation. Cutoff involves emotional isolation, rigid boundaries, and pseudo-independence. Both patterns reflect differentiation failure. Substances provide artificial solution - creating distance in enmeshment or numbing isolation in cutoff.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies enmeshment-cutoff patterns, differentiation level, and boundary problems. Treatment includes structural family therapy, boundary work, and individuation therapy. Focus on developing appropriate boundaries, tolerating separation, and maintaining connection.
  lay_description: Some families are too close (enmeshed) with members unable to be separate individuals, while others are too distant (cutoff) with no real connection. Both extremes drive substance use - to escape suffocating closeness or to fill the emptiness of isolation.
  structural_components: Rigid boundaries, fused or isolated identity, broken bonds
  social_processes: Clinging or avoiding, fusion or isolation, dependence or detachment
  societal_relevance: Creates codependency, isolation, and addiction as pseudo-solution
