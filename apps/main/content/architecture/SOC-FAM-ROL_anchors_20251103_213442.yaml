  - Healthy support
  - Appropriate boundaries
  - Natural consequences
  scope: Family members provide emotional support while maintaining clear boundaries that allow the addicted member to experience natural consequences of their behavior, fostering accountability and motivation for change.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the enabling behavior aspect of role dynamics, focusing on how families can support recovery through appropriate boundary-setting rather than protective overinvolvement.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as flexible, differentiated support that respects individual autonomy while maintaining connection, allowing both care and consequences to coexist.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-exe-bou-ada (psychological boundaries), phy-neu-pfc-inh-reg (behavioral inhibition), and exi-mea-res-acc-pur (accepting responsibility).
  academic_description: Research demonstrates that allowing natural consequences while providing emotional support creates optimal conditions for change motivation. Studies show families trained in CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training) achieve better outcomes by reinforcing sobriety while permitting consequences for use.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies specific enabling behaviors through behavioral analysis and consequence mapping. Interventions include CRAFT training, boundary-setting exercises, and coaching families to step back from protective behaviors while maintaining emotional availability.
  lay_description: Healthy family support means caring about someone without protecting them from every consequence. It's letting them face the results of their choices while still being there emotionally - like not calling in sick for them but offering to talk about their struggles.
  structural_components: Clear role boundaries, consistent consequence enforcement, emotional availability without behavioral rescue

  scope: Family members systematically shield the addicted person from experiencing consequences through protective behaviors like making excuses, covering responsibilities, and preventing natural outcomes that might motivate change.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the enabling behavior aspect of role dynamics, showing how rigid protective patterns maintain addiction by preventing the natural consequences that could motivate recovery.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as rigid, enmeshed protection that eliminates boundaries between family members' responsibilities, creating a system where consequences are absorbed by others.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-exe-bou-mal (boundary dissolution), phy-neu-pfc-inh-dys (disinhibition), and exi-mea-res-avo-dir (responsibility avoidance).
  academic_description: Enabling behaviors prevent the natural consequences that create motivation for change. Research shows families who consistently shield members from consequences inadvertently reinforce addiction patterns. Studies demonstrate enabling correlates with longer addiction duration and poorer treatment outcomes.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies patterns of calling in sick, paying bills, making excuses, and cleaning up messes. Interventions focus on recognizing enabling, understanding its function, and developing alternatives through psychoeducation and behavioral experiments with allowing consequences.
  lay_description: Enabling means protecting someone from the consequences of their addiction - calling their boss with excuses, paying their overdue bills, cleaning up their messes. While meant to help, it actually prevents them from feeling the need to change.
