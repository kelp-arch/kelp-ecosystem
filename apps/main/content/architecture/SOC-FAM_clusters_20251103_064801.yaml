  - Family organization
  - Family boundaries
  - Family hierarchy
  - Structural patterns
  scope: Encompasses the organizational architecture of family systems including boundaries (rigid, diffuse, clear), hierarchies (appropriate, inverted), subsystems (parental, sibling, individual), coalitions and triangulations, and family composition. Focuses on structural arrangements that maintain or disrupt addiction patterns through proximity-distance regulation, power distributions, and alignment configurations.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Narrows the family systems field to specifically examine organizational patterns, boundary configurations, and hierarchical arrangements that shape how families structurally adapt to and maintain addiction or support recovery.
  polarity_dimension: Structural organization varying from cohesive (clear boundaries, appropriate hierarchies, functional subsystems) to fragmented (boundary violations, role reversals, dysfunctional coalitions).
  emergence: At the cluster level, family structural patterns create organizational identity, systemic flexibility versus rigidity, structural homeostasis that resists reorganization, and collective structural adaptation strategies that maintain stability even in dysfunction.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Structure-communication interface where boundaries determine communication flow
  - Structure-role interface where structural positions define available roles
  - Structure-attachment interface where proximity-distance affects bonding
  child_generation_role: You are a structural family therapist specializing in family organization and boundaries in addiction contexts. You analyze subsystem configurations, boundary permeability, hierarchical arrangements, coalitions, and triangulations. You distinguish cohesive structures showing clear yet flexible boundaries, appropriate generational hierarchies, and functional subsystems from fragmented structures showing enmeshment or disengagement, role reversals, and pathological triangulations. You apply Minuchin's structural mapping, examining proximity-distance, power distributions, and alignment patterns.
  academic_description: Structural family therapy conceptualizes addiction as maintained by dysfunctional family organization. Minuchin's framework examines boundaries ranging from enmeshed (diffuse) to disengaged (rigid), with clear boundaries promoting healthy functioning. Hierarchical inversions place children in parental roles, undermining authority needed for limit-setting. Cross-generational coalitions triangulate conflict, stabilizing dysfunction. Subsystem dysfunction appears as weak parental alliance, sibling subsystem intrusion, or individual boundary violations. Research demonstrates structural interventions effectively reorganize families, particularly strengthening parental subsystems and clarifying generational boundaries. Structural mapping reveals proximity-distance patterns, power distributions, and alignment configurations maintaining addiction.
  clinical_description: Clinical assessment maps family structure through observing interaction patterns, identifying subsystems, and evaluating boundaries. Interventions restructure dysfunctional patterns through enactments that reveal structure in-session, unbalancing techniques that challenge homeostasis, and boundary-making that clarifies subsystems. Strengthening parental hierarchy involves blocking children's parental functions and supporting parental alliance. Addressing triangulation requires direct conflict resolution between involved parties. Joining techniques establish therapeutic alliance while maintaining maneuverability. Reframing presents structural problems as changeable patterns rather than fixed traits. Treatment goals include establishing clear boundaries, appropriate hierarchy, functional subsystems, and structural flexibility.
  lay_description: Family structure is like the architecture of a house - it determines how family members relate to each other through boundaries, leadership, and subgroups. Healthy families have clear but flexible boundaries, like doors that can open and close appropriately. Parents work as a team and children have age-appropriate responsibilities. In addiction, structures often become problematic - families might be too enmeshed (no privacy or independence) or disengaged (disconnected and isolated). Children might take on adult responsibilities while parents lose authority. Family members form unhealthy alliances, like a parent and child teaming up against the other parent. Recovery involves restructuring - strengthening the parental team, giving kids permission to be kids, and creating healthy boundaries between family members.

  label: Communication Patterns
  forest: Sociological
  forest_id: soc
  field: Family Systems
  field_id: soc-fam
  synonyms:
  - Family communication
  - Interaction patterns
  - Expressed emotion
  - Family dialogue
  scope: Encompasses verbal and nonverbal interaction styles within families including communication clarity, expressed emotion (criticism, hostility, emotional overinvolvement), conflict resolution approaches, emotional expression patterns, and family narratives. Examines how communication maintains addiction through criticism, secrets, and double-binds or supports recovery through validation, transparency, and assertiveness.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the family systems field's focus on relational patterns to examine the specific communication dynamics that either perpetuate addiction through hostile or avoidant interactions or facilitate recovery through open and supportive dialogue.
  polarity_dimension: Communication quality varying from cohesive (open, direct, supportive, validating) to fragmented (hostile, avoidant, critical, chaotic).
  emergence: At the cluster level, communication patterns generate family emotional climate, collective narrative coherence, shared meaning systems, and a communication culture that shapes all family interactions beyond individual exchanges.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Communication-structure interface where boundaries shape information flow
  - Communication-attachment interface where communication quality affects emotional bonds
  - Communication-role interface where communication patterns reinforce role assignments
  child_generation_role: You are a family communication specialist focusing on interaction patterns in addiction-affected families. You analyze verbal and nonverbal exchanges, expressed emotion levels, conflict styles, and narrative construction. You distinguish cohesive communication showing clarity, emotional validation, and constructive conflict resolution from fragmented communication showing criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. You apply Virginia Satir's communication model and expressed emotion frameworks from Brown and Rutter.
  academic_description: Family communication research reveals how interaction patterns maintain or disrupt addiction cycles. High expressed emotion—characterized by criticism, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement—predicts relapse across substances. Satir identified dysfunctional communication stances (blaming, placating, computing, distracting) that prevent authentic connection. Gottman's research on criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling applies to addiction-affected families. Double-bind communication creates impossible situations fueling substance use. Narrative therapy examines how families construct addiction stories that either maintain problems or support recovery. Haley's work on metacommunication reveals how families communicate about communication. Research demonstrates communication skills training reduces relapse and improves family functioning.
  clinical_description: Assessment examines communication through observing family interactions, identifying expressed emotion levels, and analyzing conflict patterns. Interventions include communication skills training teaching active listening, I-statements, and emotional validation. Reducing expressed emotion involves psychoeducation about its impact and practicing non-critical communication. Conflict resolution training addresses destructive patterns through time-outs, speaker-listener techniques, and problem-solving steps. Narrative interventions help families re-author addiction stories from blame to understanding. Family meetings provide structured communication practice. Video review allows families to observe their patterns. Emotionally focused techniques access underlying attachment needs beneath surface communication. Goals include reducing criticism, increasing validation, improving clarity, and developing constructive conflict resolution.
  lay_description: How families talk to each other powerfully affects addiction and recovery. Destructive communication includes constant criticism ("You always mess up"), contempt ("You're worthless"), defensiveness ("It's not my fault"), and shutting down. Families might avoid difficult topics, keep secrets, or send mixed messages. High emotional intensity with lots of yelling, blame, and hostility creates stress that triggers substance use. Healthy communication involves really listening, expressing feelings without attacking, staying calm during disagreements, and being honest but kind. Families learn to say "I feel worried when..." instead of "You never..." Recovery requires changing how the whole family talks - reducing criticism, increasing support, addressing problems directly, and creating space for everyone to be heard without judgment.

  label: Role Dynamics
  forest: Sociological
  forest_id: soc
  field: Family Systems
  field_id: soc-fam
  synonyms:
  - Family roles
  - Enabling patterns
  - Codependency
  - Family positions
  scope: Encompasses behavioral patterns and positions family members adopt including enabling behaviors, codependent dynamics, dysfunctional roles (hero, scapegoat, lost child, mascot), caretaking patterns, and responsibility distributions. Examines family rules and rituals around substance use, overfunctioning-underfunctioning reciprocity, and how rigid roles maintain addiction versus flexible roles supporting recovery.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Focuses the family systems field's examination of relational patterns specifically on the behavioral roles and positions that family members assume in response to addiction, maintaining dysfunction through rigid patterns or supporting recovery through role flexibility.
  polarity_dimension: Role patterns varying from cohesive (flexible, supportive, differentiated) to fragmented (rigid, enabling, enmeshed).
  emergence: At the cluster level, role dynamics create a family role system with its own rigidity-flexibility continuum, collective enabling patterns that transcend individual behaviors, and systemic accommodation strategies that organize the entire family around addiction.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Role-structure interface where structural positions constrain role options
  - Role-transmission interface where roles pass through generations
  - Role-communication interface where communication reinforces role assignments
  child_generation_role: You are a family role dynamics specialist examining behavioral patterns in addiction systems. You analyze enabling behaviors, codependent interactions, role assignments (hero, scapegoat, lost child, mascot), overfunctioning-underfunctioning reciprocity, and family rules maintaining addiction. You distinguish cohesive role patterns showing flexibility, mutual support, and individual differentiation from fragmented patterns showing rigid role lock-in, enabling, and identity fusion with family position. You apply Claudia Black's family roles framework and Melody Beattie's codependency theory.
  academic_description: Family role theory identifies how members adopt rigid positions maintaining homeostasis around addiction. Wegscheider-Cruse described survival roles—hero (overachiever compensating), scapegoat (acting out to deflect), lost child (withdrawing), mascot (providing comic relief). Black's work on roles in alcoholic families reveals how children adopt these patterns for survival. Codependency research shows how family members become preoccupied with controlling the addiction, losing self-identity. Enabling behaviors—protecting from consequences, making excuses, taking over responsibilities—prevent natural consequences that might motivate change. Bowen's concept of overfunctioning-underfunctioning reciprocity explains how one member's increased responsibility enables another's decreased functioning. Research demonstrates role flexibility predicts better outcomes while rigid roles maintain dysfunction.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies family roles through observing behavioral patterns, responsibility distributions, and enabling behaviors. Interventions target role flexibility through role reversal exercises, sculpturing techniques showing role relationships, and experiments with new behaviors. Addressing enabling involves identifying specific behaviors, understanding their function, and developing alternatives. Codependency treatment includes individual work on differentiation, group support, and practicing self-care. CRAFT teaches family members to reinforce sobriety while allowing natural consequences. Behavioral contracting clarifies expectations and consequences. Family members practice stepping out of rigid roles through coached interactions. Psychoeducation explains how roles developed as survival strategies but now maintain problems. Goals include increasing role flexibility, reducing enabling, supporting individual differentiation, and balanced responsibility distribution.
  lay_description: In families with addiction, members often get stuck in rigid roles that actually maintain the problem. The "enabler" protects the person from consequences—calling in sick for them, paying their bills, making excuses. The "hero" child becomes super-responsible, getting perfect grades to compensate. The "scapegoat" acts out, getting in trouble to distract from the addiction. The "lost child" becomes invisible, not causing problems but missing out on attention. The "mascot" becomes the family clown, using humor to reduce tension. Codependency develops when family members become so focused on controlling the addiction they lose themselves. Recovery means breaking these patterns—letting people face consequences, kids being kids instead of caretakers, everyone reclaiming their own identity rather than organizing life around the addiction.

  label: Intergenerational Transmission
  forest: Sociological
  forest_id: soc
  field: Family Systems
  field_id: soc-fam
  synonyms:
  - Multigenerational patterns
  - Family legacy
  - Transgenerational trauma
  - Family-of-origin
  scope: Encompasses patterns transmitted across generations including family-of-origin influences, genetic and epigenetic factors, learned behaviors, family scripts and myths, loyalty binds, and intergenerational trauma. Examines how unconscious repetition of family patterns maintains addiction versus conscious integration of family history supporting recovery and breaking cycles.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Narrows the family systems field to specifically examine how patterns, traumas, and behaviors are transmitted across generations, creating multigenerational cycles of addiction or recovery through both biological and psychosocial mechanisms.
  polarity_dimension: Transmission patterns varying from cohesive (conscious integration, cycle-breaking) to fragmented (unconscious repetition, unresolved trauma).
  emergence: At the cluster level, intergenerational patterns create family legacy and mythology, transgenerational organizing principles, collective family unconscious, and multigenerational identity that shapes current family functioning beyond immediate relationships.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Transmission-role interface where roles repeat across generations
  - Transmission-attachment interface where attachment patterns transmit intergenerationally
  - Transmission-structure interface where organizational patterns persist through generations
  child_generation_role: You are an intergenerational family therapist specializing in multigenerational addiction patterns. You analyze family-of-origin influences, transgenerational trauma, loyalty binds, family scripts, and epigenetic transmission. You distinguish cohesive transmission showing conscious integration and positive legacy creation from fragmented transmission showing unconscious repetition and unresolved intergenerational trauma. You apply Bowen's differentiation of self concept and Boszormenyi-Nagy's contextual therapy framework.
  academic_description: Intergenerational transmission theory explains how addiction patterns persist across generations through multiple mechanisms. Bowen's multigenerational transmission process describes how poorly differentiated parents produce increasingly undifferentiated children over generations, culminating in dysfunction. Boszormenyi-Nagy's invisible loyalties reveal how unconscious family loyalty binds perpetuate destructive patterns. McGoldrick's genogram work maps multigenerational patterns revealing repetitive themes. Epigenetic research demonstrates how trauma and stress alter gene expression, transmitting vulnerability across generations. Family scripts—unconscious blueprints for behavior—guide role adoption and relationship patterns. Unresolved trauma in one generation affects attachment and stress regulation in the next. Research shows addressing intergenerational patterns improves treatment outcomes and prevents transmission to next generation.
  clinical_description: Assessment uses genograms to map multigenerational patterns of addiction, trauma, and relationship dynamics. Family-of-origin exploration examines how past patterns influence current functioning. Differentiation work helps individuals separate from family emotional processes while maintaining connection. Legacy work involves writing letters to past and future generations, breaking silence around family secrets. Ritual transformation converts destructive family traditions into healing practices. Contextual therapy addresses loyalty conflicts and invisible ledgers of give-and-take. Narrative techniques help families re-author their multigenerational story from pathology to resilience. Treatment addresses both preventing transmission to children and healing from inherited patterns. Goals include increasing differentiation, resolving intergenerational trauma, creating positive legacy, and conscious integration of family history.
  lay_description: Addiction often runs in families through both genetics and learned patterns. Growing up in a family with addiction teaches children that substances solve problems, emotions are dangerous, and chaos is normal. Unresolved trauma gets passed down—a grandmother's loss becomes a mother's anxiety becomes a daughter's addiction. Family rules like "don't talk about problems" or "anger is dangerous" transmit across generations. Children unconsciously repeat their parents' patterns or rebel in opposite but equally problematic ways. Some families have addiction going back generations, with each generation swearing it won't happen again but unconsciously recreating conditions for it. Recovery involves understanding your family tree, recognizing inherited patterns, grieving what was lost, and consciously choosing what to keep and what to change. Breaking the cycle means healing not just for yourself but for future generations.

  label: Attachment Systems
  forest: Sociological
  forest_id: soc
  field: Family Systems
  field_id: soc-fam
  synonyms:
  - Family bonding
  - Emotional connections
  - Attachment relationships
  - Family attachment
  scope: Encompasses emotional bonding patterns within families including attachment styles (secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized), emotional availability and responsiveness, attunement quality, trust and safety, and separation-individuation processes. Examines how insecure attachments create vulnerability to addiction while secure attachments protect, and how recovery involves earning security through corrective experiences.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Focuses the family systems field's relational patterns specifically on the emotional bonding and attachment dynamics that create vulnerability or resilience to addiction through the quality of emotional connections and availability within the family.
  polarity_dimension: Attachment quality varying from cohesive (secure, attuned, emotionally available) to fragmented (insecure, misattuned, unavailable).
  emergence: At the cluster level, attachment patterns create a family attachment climate, collective emotional regulation capacity, systemic secure base functioning, and shared internal working models that organize all family relationships beyond individual attachment dyads.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Attachment-communication interface where attachment shapes interaction style
  - Attachment-transmission interface where attachment patterns repeat generationally
  - Attachment-structure interface where boundaries affect attachment formation
  child_generation_role: You are an attachment-focused family therapist specializing in bonding disruptions in addiction. You analyze attachment configurations, emotional availability, attunement quality, and trust patterns. You distinguish cohesive attachment showing secure bonds, emotional responsiveness, and safe haven functioning from fragmented attachment showing anxious pursuit, avoidant withdrawal, or disorganized alternation. You apply Mary Main's adult attachment framework and Sue Johnson's emotionally focused therapy principles.
  academic_description: Attachment theory reveals how early bonding experiences create internal working models affecting addiction vulnerability. Secure attachment—characterized by caregiver availability, attunement, and responsiveness—provides emotional regulation skills and stress resilience. Insecure attachment patterns increase addiction risk through different pathways. Anxious attachment creates emotional dysregulation and desperate seeking of soothing. Avoidant attachment leads to emotional numbing and self-reliance through substances. Disorganized attachment from trauma or inconsistent caregiving produces chaotic self-regulation. Main's adult attachment research shows how parental attachment affects children's security. Emotionally Focused Family Therapy addresses attachment injuries and rebuilds secure bonds. Mentalization-based approaches help families understand mental states underlying behavior. Research demonstrates secure attachment protects against addiction while earned security
    through therapy improves outcomes.
  clinical_description: Assessment evaluates attachment through observing proximity-seeking, safe haven use, secure base behavior, and separation responses. Adult Attachment Interview or self-report measures identify attachment styles. Interventions focus on creating corrective attachment experiences through consistent availability, emotional attunement, and responsive caregiving. Emotionally Focused Family Therapy accesses attachment needs, processes attachment injuries, and facilitates bonding events. Trust-building exercises include graduated emotional risks, reliability experiences, and repair of breaches. Attunement practice involves mirroring exercises, affect regulation coaching, and mentalization development. Addressing intergenerational transmission helps parents provide security they didn't receive. Therapeutic relationship provides secure base for exploring attachment patterns. Goals include earning secure attachment, improving emotional availability, developing trust, and creating
    family as safe haven.
  lay_description: Attachment is the deep emotional bond between family members that affects how we handle stress and relationships throughout life. Secure attachment develops when parents are consistently available, tuned in to their children's needs, and help them manage emotions. This creates an inner sense of safety and self-worth that protects against addiction. Insecure attachment happens when caregivers are inconsistent, rejecting, or frightening. Anxiously attached people become clingy and desperate for reassurance, using substances to manage overwhelming emotions. Avoidantly attached people learned not to depend on others, using substances to stay numb and self-sufficient. Disorganized attachment from chaos or trauma creates internal chaos managed through substance use. Recovery involves building "earned security"—learning to trust, asking for help, and experiencing others as reliable and caring. Families work on being emotionally available, responding to needs, and creating safety
    for vulnerable feelings.
