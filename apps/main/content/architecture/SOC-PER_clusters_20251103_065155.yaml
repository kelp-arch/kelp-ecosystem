    child_generation_role: You are a network structure analyst specializing in peer network topology and addiction. You examine network density, clustering coefficients, centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector), and structural positions. You analyze core-periphery structures, network fragmentation indices, and tie strength distributions. You distinguish cohesive networks with high density, reciprocal ties, and structural cohesion from fragmented networks showing structural holes, weak ties, and isolated components. You apply graph theory, Burt's structural holes theory, and Coleman's social capital framework to understand how network architecture facilitates or impedes substance use and recovery.
    academic_description: Network structure research examines how the architecture of peer relationships shapes addiction and recovery trajectories. Graph theory and social network analysis reveal that network density (proportion of possible ties present), clustering (tendency for friends of friends to be friends), and centrality (importance of position) predict substance use patterns. Dense, clustered networks with substance users create echo chambers reinforcing use through redundant pathways of influence. Central positions in using networks increase exposure while peripheral positions may enable exit. Structural holes—gaps between disconnected groups—can facilitate behavior change by providing bridges to recovery communities. Weak ties to diverse groups offer access to new resources and norms. Recovery often requires structural transformation from dense using networks to strategically configured recovery networks balancing bonding ties within recovery communities and bridging ties to broader social resources.
    clinical_description: Network structure interventions map and modify peer relationship patterns to support recovery. Network mapping visualizes the client's social connections, identifying high-risk clusters, supportive relationships, and structural opportunities for change. Assessment examines network size, density of substance users, position within using networks, and access to recovery-oriented connections. Interventions may involve strategic network restructuring—gradually reducing ties to central members of using networks while building connections to recovery communities. Clinicians help clients identify and leverage structural holes that provide exits from using networks. Building bridging ties to new communities reduces dependence on substance-using networks. Group therapy can create new network clusters supporting recovery. The structural perspective recognizes that sustainable change often requires fundamental reorganization of social network architecture rather than just changing individual relationships.
    lay_description: The structure of your social network—how your friends connect to each other—affects your substance use and recovery. If all your friends know each other and use substances, you're surrounded with no easy way out. Being at the center of a using group means constant exposure and pressure. But having connections to different social circles creates opportunities for change. Some relationships are strong and close, others are casual acquaintances—both matter differently. Dense, tight-knit groups reinforce their shared behaviors, making change difficult. Recovery often means restructuring your social world—not just changing friends but changing how your social network is organized. This might mean becoming less central in using groups, building bridges to recovery communities, and creating a network that supports sobriety. The goal is a balanced network with close recovery friends for support and diverse connections for opportunities and resources.

      - Network-behavior coevolution
      - Assortative mixing
    scope: Bidirectional processes of peer selection based on similarity and influence leading to behavior change. Includes homophily effects, assortative mixing patterns, selection versus influence decomposition, and network-behavior coevolution. Examines how individuals choose similar friends and become similar to their friends over time.
    parent_scope_inheritance: Elaborates the peer networks field's focus on selection and influence processes by examining the dynamic interplay between choosing friends based on substance use and changing behavior due to peer influence.
    polarity_dimension: Process integration ranging from cohesive (strong, reinforcing selection-influence cycles) to fragmented (weak or disrupted selection-influence patterns)
    emergence: Selection-influence spirals creating behavioral convergence, network evolution trajectories, dynamic equilibria between selection and influence, and cascading effects through network generations
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Selection-structure interface where network topology constrains selection opportunities
      - Selection-learning interface where observed behaviors guide friend selection
      - Selection-support interface where recovery needs drive network selection
    child_generation_role: You are a selection-influence dynamics researcher specializing in peer network evolution and substance use. You analyze homophily coefficients, selection versus influence parameters using SIENA models, and assortative mixing patterns. You examine friend selection based on substance use similarity, influence effects on behavior change, and the coevolution of networks and behaviors. You distinguish cohesive selection-influence cycles showing strong homophily and influence effects from fragmented patterns with weak selection and limited influence. You apply Kandel's homophily framework, McPherson's birds of a feather principle, and Steglich's network-behavior coevolution models.
    academic_description: Selection-influence research reveals the bidirectional relationship between peer networks and substance use through sophisticated longitudinal modeling. Stochastic actor-oriented models decompose network-behavior coevolution into selection effects (choosing friends based on similar substance use) and influence effects (adopting friends' substance use behaviors). Homophily—the tendency for similarity to breed connection—operates through multiple mechanisms including opportunity structures, preference for similarity, and social comfort. Selection creates behavioral clustering within networks before any influence occurs. Influence then operates through multiple pathways including peer pressure, norm transmission, and behavioral modeling. Meta-analyses show both effects contribute significantly, with selection often stronger in adolescence. Recovery involves reversing these dynamics—selecting recovery-oriented peers and being influenced toward sobriety. Understanding selection-influence dynamics is crucial for interventions since addressing only influence while ignoring selection limits effectiveness.
    clinical_description: Clinical approaches address both selection and influence processes in peer relationships. Assessment uses timeline techniques to map how friendships and substance use coevolved, identifying whether problems stem more from friend selection or peer influence. For adolescents, interventions may focus on expanding selection pools beyond substance-using peers through structured activities, sports, or interest groups. Social skills training helps resist negative influence while maintaining friendships where possible. Network interventions guide strategic friend selection—helping clients identify and pursue relationships with peers supporting recovery goals. Motivational interviewing explores ambivalence about peer relationships and substance use. Group therapy provides a controlled environment for new peer selection and positive influence. Clinicians help clients recognize how they both choose and are changed by their friends, developing agency in relationship formation. Long-term recovery planning includes strategies for ongoing peer selection aligned with recovery goals.
    lay_description: You both choose friends like yourself and become like your friends—this two-way process powerfully affects substance use. People naturally connect with similar others (birds of a feather), so if you use substances, you'll likely befriend other users. Then, spending time together reinforces shared behaviors. It's a cycle. Selection leads to influence, which affects future selection. Breaking this cycle is key to recovery. You might need to consciously seek different types of friends—joining activities where you'll meet people with healthy lifestyles. At the same time, you'll need skills to resist influence from current friends who use. Recovery often means being intentional about who you spend time with, recognizing that you'll naturally become more like your close friends over time. The good news is this works positively too—choosing recovery-focused friends helps maintain sobriety through positive influence.

    scope: Processes through which substance use behaviors, attitudes, and skills are acquired through peer observation and interaction. Includes modeling effects, vicarious reinforcement, outcome expectancy development, and social transmission of use patterns. Examines how peers serve as behavioral models and sources of social reinforcement.
    parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the peer networks field's focus on social learning by examining the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms through which substance use patterns are transmitted through peer observation and reinforcement.
    polarity_dimension: Learning coherence ranging from cohesive (consistent behavioral models and reinforcement) to fragmented (contradictory models and mixed learning signals)
    emergence: Collective behavioral scripts, shared outcome expectancies, group-level efficacy beliefs, and cultural transmission of substance use practices through peer networks
    boundary_interfaces:
      - Learning-influence interface where observed behaviors shape susceptibility to influence
      - Learning-pressure interface where learned norms affect conformity responses
      - Learning-support interface where recovery models facilitate behavior change
    child_generation_role: You are a social learning researcher specializing in peer-mediated behavioral transmission in addiction. You analyze observational learning processes, modeling effects, vicarious reinforcement patterns, and outcome expectancy development. You examine how substance use behaviors, attitudes, and skills are acquired through peer observation. You distinguish cohesive learning environments with consistent behavioral models and reinforcement from fragmented contexts with contradictory models and mixed messages. You apply Bandura's social cognitive theory, Akers' social learning theory of deviance, and Oetting's peer cluster theory to understand behavioral acquisition and maintenance.
    academic_description: Social learning theory explains how substance use behaviors spread through peer networks via observation, imitation, and reinforcement. Bandura's framework identifies four processes- attention (observing peer behavior), retention (encoding behavioral sequences), reproduction (enacting observed behaviors), and motivation (reinforcement outcomes). Peers provide behavioral models demonstrating substance use techniques, contexts, and consequences. Vicarious reinforcement occurs when observing peers' positive experiences with substances increases use likelihood. Differential reinforcement—the balance of rewards and punishments—shapes behavioral patterns. Outcome expectancies develop through observing peer consequences, creating cognitive templates for anticipated effects. Social learning is particularly powerful during adolescence when peer models supersede parental influence. Recovery involves exposure to recovery models demonstrating sober living skills and positive outcomes. Peer recovery coaches exemplify successful recovery paths. Understanding social learning mechanisms enables interventions that provide alternative behavioral models and reshape outcome expectancies.
    clinical_description: Treatment approaches leverage social learning principles to modify substance use behaviors. Assessment examines exposure to substance use models, observed consequences, and developed expectancies about use effects. Interventions provide systematic exposure to recovery models through peer mentors, recovery coaches, and group therapy. Video modeling shows successful coping strategies and refusal skills. Role-playing allows behavioral rehearsal with corrective feedback. Peer-led interventions capitalize on credible models who've achieved recovery. Cognitive restructuring addresses distorted outcome expectancies developed through selective observation. Groups provide multiple models demonstrating varied recovery paths. Vicarious learning from others' experiences reduces need for direct negative consequences. Clinicians help clients identify and learn from positive peer models while recognizing and countering negative modeling influences. Skills training includes observation skills to learn from successful peers. Treatment communities provide immersive environments with consistent recovery modeling and reinforcement.
    lay_description: You learn substance use behaviors by watching your friends—seeing what they do, how they do it, and what happens afterward. If friends seem to have fun while using, you learn to expect positive outcomes. You pick up not just whether to use, but how, when, where, and with whom. This learning happens automatically through observation, even without direct pressure. Friends demonstrate techniques, rituals, and ways of thinking about substances. In recovery, the same learning process works positively. Being around people in recovery shows you how to have fun sober, handle stress without substances, and build meaningful relationships. Recovery groups provide multiple examples of successful sobriety. Peer mentors who've been through similar struggles offer credible models for change. The key is consciously choosing which behaviors to observe and learn from—seeking out people who model the life you want rather than unconsciously absorbing unhealthy patterns.

      - Support-learning interface where recovery models inspire change
    child_generation_role: You are a peer recovery support specialist analyzing mutual aid and peer support systems in addiction recovery. You examine support functions (emotional, informational, instrumental, affiliational), reciprocity patterns, and recovery capital accumulation through peer relationships. You analyze 12-step networks, SMART Recovery groups, peer recovery coaching relationships, and recovery community dynamics. You distinguish cohesive support systems with diverse support functions, reciprocal helping, and strong recovery identity from fragmented systems showing limited support, unidirectional help, and weak recovery connections. You apply House's social support taxonomy, Putnam's social capital theory, and White's recovery capital framework.
    academic_description: "Peer support research demonstrates how recovery-oriented relationships facilitate sustained sobriety through multiple mechanisms. Social support theory identifies four key functions: emotional (empathy, caring), informational (advice, guidance), instrumental (tangible aid), and affiliational (sense of belonging). Mutual aid principles emphasize reciprocal helping where supporting others strengthens one's own recovery. Helper therapy principle shows that providing support yields greater benefits than receiving it. Recovery capital accumulates through peer relationships, building resources for sustained recovery. Twelve-step programs leverage peer support through sponsorship, meeting attendance, and service work. Recovery community organizations provide peer recovery coaching, sober social activities, and recovery housing. Social identity theory explains how recovery group membership fosters recovery identity. Network support for abstinence strongly predicts sustained recovery. Peer support addresses experiential knowledge gaps that professionals cannot fill. Research shows peer support improves treatment retention, reduces relapse rates, and enhances quality of life."
    clinical_description: Peer support interventions mobilize lived experience to support recovery. Assessment evaluates current recovery support, network abstinence support, and recovery community involvement. Twelve-step facilitation connects clients to established mutual aid networks, addressing barriers to engagement. Peer recovery coaches—individuals with lived experience—provide mentoring, advocacy, and recovery planning support. Group therapy creates peer support opportunities within treatment. Recovery community centers offer sober social activities building recovery-oriented friendships. Telephone recovery support provides between-session peer contact. Online recovery communities extend support access. Interventions address common barriers including social anxiety, trust issues, and difficulty asking for help. Clinicians help clients navigate different support options—12-step, SMART Recovery, faith-based recovery, or secular alternatives. Building reciprocal relationships where clients both give and receive support enhances engagement. Long-term recovery planning includes maintaining peer support connections beyond formal treatment.
    lay_description: People who've been through addiction and recovery understand your struggle in ways others can't. Peer support means connecting with others in recovery for mutual help and understanding. This might include 12-step groups where members share experience and support each other, recovery coaches who've been where you are and can guide your journey, or sober social groups for fun without substances. These relationships provide practical advice, emotional support when struggling, and proof that recovery is possible. Helping others in their recovery actually strengthens your own—it reminds you how far you've come and reinforces your commitment. Recovery communities offer belonging and identity beyond addiction. Having friends who support your sobriety makes staying clean easier than doing it alone. These aren't professional relationships but genuine friendships based on shared experience and mutual support. Building a recovery support network takes time but provides the understanding, accountability, and hope essential for long-term recovery.
