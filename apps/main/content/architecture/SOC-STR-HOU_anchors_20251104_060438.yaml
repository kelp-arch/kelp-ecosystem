  scope: Stable, secure housing arrangements with predictable tenure, protection from displacement, and continuity of residence that enables establishment of routines, social connections, and treatment engagement.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the housing stability dimension of spatial environment, focusing on the security and continuity of residential arrangements rather than quality or location.
  polarity_expression: Manifests as cohesive spatial structures through secure tenure, predictable housing transitions, and protection from involuntary displacement that maintains social networks and service connections.
  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-cog-exe (executive stability supporting housing maintenance), phy-neu-str (reduced stress from housing security), and exi-mea-sec (existential security from stable home base).
  academic_description: Research demonstrates housing stability as foundational for recovery, with secure tenure reducing relapse risk through decreased stress, maintained social support, and treatment continuity. Studies show stable housing improves medication adherence, appointment attendance, and recovery outcomes independent of housing quality.

  academic_description: Substandard housing research documents multiple pathways to addiction. Environmental stressors from poor conditions increase substance use for coping. Health problems from mold, lead, and pests create pain and disability. Overcrowding disrupts sleep and privacy needed for recovery.
  clinical_description: Assessment screens for environmental hazards, overcrowding, and utility shutoffs. Interventions address immediate safety concerns, advocate for repairs, and provide temporary relocation when necessary. Poor conditions often trigger relapse and complicate medical management.
  lay_description: Living with broken heat, mold on the walls, or rats in your home creates constant stress that makes you want to use substances just to cope. When you're sick from bad conditions or can't sleep because of noise and crowding, recovery feels impossible.

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with psy-soc-iso (social isolation from service gaps), phy-tre-bar (treatment barriers), and exi-mea-hop (hopelessness from absent resources).
  academic_description: Service desert research reveals how geographic inequity perpetuates addiction. Lack of proximate treatment increases dropout, reduces medication adherence, and limits recovery support access. Transportation barriers compound disadvantage, creating effective treatment exclusion.
  clinical_description: Assessment identifies service gaps, transportation barriers, and unmet needs. Interventions include mobile treatment units, telehealth services, and intensive case management to bridge gaps. Address frustration and hopelessness from systemic barriers.
  lay_description: When the nearest clinic is hours away by multiple buses, or there are no support groups in your area, getting help becomes nearly impossible. You might want treatment but simply can't access it, especially without a car or money for transportation.
  structural_components: Service gaps, clinic closures, transportation deserts, infrastructure deficits, funding disparities

  cross_domain_resonance: Resonates with phy-neu-sen (heightened cue sensitivity), psy-beh-imp (increased impulsive use), and exi-val-con (value conflicts in toxic environments).
  academic_description: High exposure research reveals environmental injustice in outlet placement. Minority and low-income neighborhoods face disproportionate outlet density, aggressive marketing, and drug market concentration. Constant exposure increases use through availability, cueing, and normalization.
  clinical_description: Assessment maps exposure intensity, trigger locations, and avoidance possibilities. Interventions include intensive trigger management, relocation when possible, and coping skills for unavoidable exposure. High exposure environments require enhanced support and relapse prevention.
  lay_description: When there's a liquor store on every block, drug dealers on the corner, and advertisements everywhere you look, staying clean becomes a daily battle. The constant reminders and easy availability make it feel like the whole neighborhood is pushing you to use.
