  - Economic-justice interface through employment discrimination
  child_generation_role: You are an economic sociologist specializing in poverty, inequality, and human capital impacts on addiction. You analyze income distribution, wage structures, employment stability, educational attainment, and skill development opportunities. You examine unemployment rates, minimum wage adequacy, job quality indicators, income support programs, educational funding, and credential barriers. You distinguish cohesive economic systems with living wages, stable employment, and educational access from fragmented systems marked by precarious work, poverty wages, and blocked educational pathways. You ground analysis in fundamental cause theory, human capital theory, and economic stress models.
  academic_description: Economic and human capital systems research examines how material conditions and educational opportunities shape addiction trajectories. Fundamental cause theory demonstrates how socioeconomic status persistently affects health through resource access and risk exposure. Economic stress models link financial strain to substance use as coping mechanism. Human capital theory reveals how educational disruption perpetuates cycles of disadvantage. Research documents wage stagnation, job insecurity, and benefit erosion increasing vulnerability. Studies show unemployment doubling addiction risk while stable employment supports recovery. Educational attainment provides cognitive resources, health literacy, and economic returns protecting against addiction. Income inequality research reveals relative deprivation effects beyond absolute poverty. Precarious employment creates chronic stress without adequate resources for treatment.
  clinical_description: Clinical practice addresses economic factors through comprehensive assessment and targeted interventions. Screening evaluates employment history, income stability, educational background, and financial stressors. Supportive employment programs help clients find and maintain work during recovery. Vocational rehabilitation addresses skill deficits and workplace readiness. Financial counseling manages debt and budgeting. Educational support includes GED preparation and college access programs. Individual Placement and Support model integrates employment services with treatment. Motivational interviewing explores work identity and economic goals. Case management connects clients to income supports, job training, and educational opportunities. Clinicians recognize how economic precarity undermines recovery through stress, instability, and limited options. Interventions balance immediate economic needs with long-term human capital development.
  lay_description: Money troubles and lack of education create huge barriers to avoiding addiction and achieving recovery. When you're living paycheck to paycheck or unemployed, the stress can drive you to use substances to cope. Dead-end jobs without benefits mean you can't afford treatment even if you want it. Not finishing school limits your job options and makes it harder to understand health information. During recovery, you need stable work that provides structure, purpose, and income—but criminal records and gaps in employment make finding good jobs nearly impossible. Education opens doors to better opportunities but addiction often disrupts schooling, creating a vicious cycle. It's not just about individual choices—when the economy doesn't provide living wages, stable jobs, or educational access, addiction becomes a predictable outcome of economic desperation.

  field: Structural Factors
  field_id: soc-str
  synonyms:
  - Residential stability
  - Neighborhood disadvantage
  - Environmental exposure
  - Spatial inequality
  scope: Encompasses housing stability, homelessness, residential segregation, neighborhood characteristics, and environmental factors affecting substance exposure and recovery environments. Includes housing quality, affordability, eviction, public housing, and spatial concentration of risk.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Narrows the structural factors field to spatial and residential determinants, examining how housing conditions and neighborhood contexts create differential exposure to substances and access to recovery resources.
  polarity_dimension: Spatial structures ranging from cohesive (stable housing, resourced neighborhoods) to fragmented (housing instability, concentrated disadvantage, environmental hazards).
  emergence: At the cluster level, spatial systems manifest environmental injustice through targeted marketing and outlet concentration, place-based disadvantage that concentrates multiple risks, residential instability that disrupts treatment, and neighborhood effects that shape norms and opportunities.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Housing-economic interface through affordability and eviction
  - Housing-healthcare interface through proximity to treatment services
  - Housing-policy interface through zoning and public housing policies
  child_generation_role: You are a housing and urban sociologist specializing in residential stability and neighborhood effects on addiction. You analyze housing quality, affordability, stability, homelessness prevalence, and neighborhood characteristics including poverty concentration, collective efficacy, and substance outlet density. You examine eviction patterns, public housing conditions, residential segregation, supportive housing models, and environmental hazards. You distinguish cohesive spatial environments with stable, affordable housing and resourced neighborhoods from fragmented environments marked by housing precarity, homelessness, and concentrated disadvantage. You apply environmental justice frameworks, neighborhood effects research, and Housing First principles.
  academic_description: Housing and spatial environment research reveals how residential conditions shape addiction risk and recovery possibilities. Environmental justice scholarship documents systematic targeting of minority neighborhoods with alcohol and tobacco outlets, creating differential exposure. Concentrated disadvantage theory shows how poverty, unemployment, and family disruption cluster spatially, amplifying individual risks. Housing instability disrupts treatment continuity and social support networks essential for recovery. Homelessness creates survival priorities that supersede treatment engagement. Research demonstrates Housing First models improve both housing stability and substance use outcomes without requiring abstinence. Neighborhood collective efficacy—shared expectations for social control—influences substance use norms. Spatial mismatch between treatment services and need creates access barriers. Eviction cascades trigger substance use through acute stress and displacement.
    Public housing policies that exclude people with drug convictions perpetuate homelessness and marginalization.
  clinical_description: Clinical practice increasingly recognizes housing as healthcare foundation. Assessment evaluates current housing status, stability history, neighborhood stressors, and environmental triggers. Housing First approaches provide immediate permanent housing without sobriety requirements. Critical Time Intervention offers intensive support during housing transitions. Rapid rehousing addresses immediate homelessness with temporary assistance. Supportive housing combines affordable units with on-site services. Treatment planning considers neighborhood context—outlet density, drug markets, social networks. Mobile treatment units reach clients in underserved areas. Peer navigators familiar with local resources guide service access. Environmental modifications reduce exposure to triggers. Clinicians advocate for clients facing eviction or housing discrimination. Trauma-informed approaches recognize how housing instability creates complex trauma. Interventions address both individual
    housing needs and systemic barriers through policy advocacy.
  lay_description: Where you live powerfully affects your addiction risk and recovery chances. Living in neighborhoods with liquor stores on every corner and no grocery stores makes drinking seem normal and healthy choices hard. When you're homeless, just surviving each day takes all your energy—finding food, staying safe, and keeping warm matter more than attending treatment. Constantly moving between couches, shelters, and the street makes it impossible to maintain medications, keep appointments, or build supportive relationships. Living in run-down housing with mold, pests, and violence creates daily stress that drives substance use. During recovery, you need a stable, safe place to rebuild your life—but landlords often refuse to rent to people with addiction histories or criminal records. Having your own space provides dignity, privacy, and control that are essential for healing. Recovery is nearly impossible without a home base.

  synonyms:
  - Legal system involvement
  - Incarceration
  - Drug criminalization
  - Justice involvement
  scope: Encompasses policing, courts, incarceration, probation/parole, and collateral consequences affecting addiction trajectories. Includes arrest patterns, sentencing, drug courts, prison conditions, reentry barriers, and criminal record impacts.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Focuses the structural factors field on criminal justice institutions and their role in shaping addiction pathways through punishment, surveillance, treatment mandates, and systemic exclusion.
  polarity_dimension: Justice systems ranging from cohesive (rehabilitative, restorative, reintegrative) to fragmented (punitive, exclusionary, surveillance-focused).
  emergence: At the cluster level, criminal justice systems create mass incarceration effects that destabilize communities, criminal justice cycling that perpetuates addiction, institutional trauma that compounds substance use, and permanent marginalization through collateral consequences.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Justice-economic interface through employment barriers for justice-involved
  - Justice-housing interface through background check exclusions
  - Justice-healthcare interface through disrupted treatment continuity
  child_generation_role: You are a criminologist specializing in drug policy and criminal justice impacts on addiction trajectories. You analyze arrest rates, prosecution patterns, sentencing disparities, incarceration conditions, and community supervision practices. You examine drug court operations, diversion programs, mandatory minimums, treatment in corrections, and reentry services. You distinguish cohesive justice systems emphasizing treatment, accountability, and reintegration from fragmented systems characterized by punishment, surveillance, and permanent exclusion. You apply therapeutic jurisprudence, restorative justice principles, and collateral consequences frameworks.
  academic_description: Criminal justice research reveals how drug criminalization shapes addiction trajectories through punishment rather than treatment. Mass incarceration disrupts families and communities, concentrating disadvantage. Labeling theory explains how criminal justice involvement creates deviant identity and social exclusion. Collateral consequences—employment barriers, housing restrictions, benefit exclusions—perpetuate marginalization long after sentence completion. Drug courts show mixed results, helping some while widening nets of control. Racial disparities in drug law enforcement create differential consequences despite similar use rates. Incarceration disrupts treatment continuity and exposes people to trauma and substance availability. Mandatory minimum sentences remove judicial discretion and prevent individualized responses. Community supervision often emphasizes surveillance over support, with technical violations returning people to incarceration. Therapeutic communities
    in prisons show promise but remain underfunded. Restorative justice approaches address harm while maintaining dignity and community connections.
  clinical_description: Clinical work with justice-involved clients requires understanding systemic barriers and trauma. Assessment explores arrest history, incarceration experiences, probation conditions, and reentry challenges. Treatment plans accommodate court mandates while maintaining therapeutic alliance. Motivational interviewing navigates external pressure and internal motivation. Trauma-informed care addresses institutional trauma from incarceration. Group work processes shared experiences of criminalization and stigma. Case management coordinates with probation officers, ensuring communication about progress and challenges. Advocacy involves court testimony, letter writing, and system navigation. Clinicians help clients manage conflicting demands from treatment and supervision. Medication-assisted treatment requires coordination with correctional facilities. Reentry planning begins before release, arranging housing, treatment, and support. Documentation balances clinical needs
    with legal requirements. Peer support from formerly incarcerated individuals provides credible hope and practical guidance.
  lay_description: Getting caught up in the criminal justice system makes addiction recovery incredibly difficult. A drug arrest can spiral into job loss, eviction, and family separation—pushing you deeper into substance use. In jail or prison, you're cut off from treatment, exposed to violence, and surrounded by drugs. When you get out, that criminal record follows you everywhere—employers won't hire you, landlords won't rent to you, and you may lose benefits like food stamps or student loans. Probation means constant drug tests, fees you can't afford, and rules that set you up to fail. One mistake sends you back to jail, disrupting any progress you've made. Drug courts promise treatment instead of incarceration but often require things that are impossible without stable housing and transportation. The system says it wants you to recover but then creates barriers at every turn. Instead of help, you get punishment that makes addiction worse.

  field_id: soc-str
  synonyms:
  - Treatment access
  - Health system barriers
  - Insurance coverage
  - Medical infrastructure
  scope: Encompasses healthcare access, insurance coverage, treatment availability, and system capacity affecting addiction services. Includes provider networks, prior authorization, treatment deserts, workforce shortages, and service integration.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Specifies the structural factors field's healthcare dimensions by examining how medical systems, insurance structures, and treatment infrastructure create differential access to addiction services.
  polarity_dimension: Healthcare systems ranging from cohesive (universal access, integrated care, adequate capacity) to fragmented (coverage gaps, service silos, treatment deserts).
  emergence: At the cluster level, healthcare systems exhibit treatment deserts where services don't exist, insurance churn that disrupts care continuity, workforce shortages that limit access, and fragmentation that prevents integrated responses to complex needs.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Healthcare-economic interface through employer-based insurance
  - Healthcare-policy interface through Medicaid expansion and regulations
  - Healthcare-spatial interface through geographic service distribution
  child_generation_role: You are a health services researcher specializing in addiction treatment systems and healthcare access. You analyze insurance coverage patterns, treatment capacity, provider availability, and service integration models. You examine Medicaid policies, prior authorization requirements, network adequacy, reimbursement rates, and workforce development. You distinguish cohesive healthcare systems with universal coverage, integrated services, and adequate capacity from fragmented systems marked by coverage gaps, treatment deserts, and discontinuous care. You apply Andersen's behavioral model, treatment cascade frameworks, and health system integration theories.
  academic_description: Healthcare system research documents systematic barriers to addiction treatment access and quality. Fragmentation between mental health, substance use, and medical care prevents integrated responses. Insurance barriers—prior authorization, step therapy, annual limits—delay or deny evidence-based treatment. Treatment deserts, particularly in rural areas, mean services simply don't exist. Workforce shortages limit capacity even where demand exists. Low Medicaid reimbursement rates discourage provider participation. Separate funding streams create service silos that don't address co-occurring conditions. Emergency departments become default treatment settings without appropriate resources. Quality measures emphasize acute care over long-term recovery support. The treatment cascade reveals drop-offs at each stage from need recognition to sustained recovery. Medicaid expansion improves access but varies by state, creating geographic inequities. Integration models like
    collaborative care show promise but require system redesign. Harm reduction services face regulatory and funding barriers despite evidence of effectiveness.
  clinical_description: Healthcare system barriers directly impact clinical practice and client outcomes. Clinicians spend excessive time on prior authorizations and insurance appeals rather than treatment. Waitlists mean clients lose motivation or deteriorate before accessing services. Insurance churn forces medication changes and provider switches, disrupting therapeutic relationships. Network inadequacy limits referral options for specialized services. Clinicians must navigate multiple funding streams with different requirements and documentation. Low reimbursement rates threaten program sustainability and workforce retention. Lack of integration means clients must tell their story repeatedly across disconnected services. Electronic health records don't communicate across systems, fragmenting care coordination. Quality metrics may not capture recovery-oriented outcomes. Advocacy involves insurance appeals, policy testimony, and system reform efforts. Peer support workers help clients
    navigate complex systems. Clinicians develop workarounds for system failures but recognize individual efforts can't overcome structural barriers.
  lay_description: Getting addiction treatment should be straightforward, but the healthcare system creates endless obstacles. Even with insurance, you might wait months for an appointment, only to find your insurance doesn't cover the treatment you need. Prior authorization means insurance companies—not doctors—decide what treatment you can get. You might have to fail at cheaper treatments first before getting what actually works. In rural areas, the nearest treatment might be hours away. When your insurance changes—because you lost your job or aged off your parents' plan—you have to start over with new providers. The emergency room becomes your only option during crisis, but they just stabilize and discharge you. Mental health and addiction services are separate, so you can't get help for both problems together. Medications that could help require special licenses and aren't available at regular pharmacies. The system makes you prove you're sick enough for treatment but not too sick for
    outpatient care. It's exhausting to navigate when you're already struggling.

  field_id: soc-str
  synonyms:
  - Drug policy
  - Regulatory frameworks
  - Legal environment
  - Policy context
  scope: Encompasses drug policies, regulations, and legal frameworks shaping societal responses to addiction. Includes drug scheduling, prescribing regulations, harm reduction policies, treatment mandates, and welfare policies affecting people who use drugs.
  parent_scope_inheritance: Focuses the structural factors field on policy and regulatory dimensions that determine what responses are legal, funded, and institutionally supported in addressing addiction.
  polarity_dimension: Policy environments ranging from cohesive (evidence-based, supportive, aligned) to fragmented (contradictory, punitive, ideologically driven).
  emergence: At the cluster level, policy systems create feedback loops that reinforce certain approaches, path dependence that resists evidence-based change, regulatory capture by vested interests, and implementation gaps between policy intent and practice.
  boundary_interfaces:
  - Policy-healthcare interface through treatment regulations and funding
  - Policy-justice interface through drug law enforcement priorities
  - Policy-economic interface through welfare and benefit policies
  child_generation_role: You are a policy analyst specializing in drug policy and regulatory impacts on addiction responses. You analyze drug scheduling decisions, prescribing regulations, harm reduction laws, treatment funding mechanisms, and welfare policies. You examine policy coherence, evidence-based policymaking processes, stakeholder influence, and implementation fidelity. You distinguish cohesive policy environments with aligned, evidence-based, supportive policies from fragmented environments marked by contradictory mandates, punitive approaches, and regulatory barriers. You apply policy feedback theory, institutional analysis, and implementation science frameworks.
  academic_description: Policy research reveals how regulatory environments shape available responses to addiction through law, funding, and institutional rules. Drug scheduling based on outdated criteria restricts research and treatment options. Prescribing regulations intended to prevent diversion create barriers to medication-assisted treatment. Federal funding restrictions prohibit harm reduction services despite overwhelming evidence. Policy feedback loops entrench punitive approaches as bureaucracies and interest groups defend existing systems. Morality politics override evidence in drug policy debates. Federalism creates patchwork of state policies with vastly different approaches. Implementation research shows gaps between policy intent and street-level practice. Welfare policies that exclude people with drug convictions perpetuate marginalization. Zoning laws concentrate treatment facilities in disadvantaged neighborhoods while excluding them from affluent areas. Professional licensing
    boards may punish healthcare workers in recovery. International drug control treaties constrain domestic policy innovation. Evidence-based policy movements promote data-driven decisions but face political resistance.
  clinical_description: Policy environments directly constrain clinical practice through regulations, funding restrictions, and mandated approaches. Prescribing regulations require special licenses and limit dosing for addiction medications. Federal restrictions prohibit certain harm reduction services regardless of evidence. Funding streams dictate what services can be provided and to whom. Clinicians must navigate conflicting regulations from multiple agencies. Documentation requirements for regulatory compliance reduce time for clinical care. Mandatory reporting laws may conflict with therapeutic relationships. Insurance regulations determine covered services and treatment duration. Professional licensing boards may impose restrictions on clinicians in recovery. Quality metrics may emphasize compliance over clinical outcomes. Advocacy involves educating policymakers, providing testimony, and participating in reform efforts. Clinicians develop strategies to work within regulatory constraints
    while advocating for evidence-based policy change. Understanding policy context helps explain system failures to clients and families.
  lay_description: Laws and regulations around drugs often make addiction worse instead of better. Politicians pass tough-on-crime laws that sound good but don't actually help anyone recover. Medications that could save lives are restricted by regulations written decades ago. Needle exchange programs that prevent HIV are illegal in many places because of moral objections. Your food stamps or housing assistance can be taken away because of a drug conviction, pushing you deeper into poverty. Treatment programs are required to use approaches that don't work because that's what the funding requires. Marijuana remains federally illegal despite state legalization, creating confusion and continued arrests. Policies change with each election, disrupting programs that were working. What's legal in one state is a felony next door. The war on drugs continues despite decades of failure because powerful interests benefit from the current system. Real solutions like safe consumption sites or drug checking
    services are blocked by politics. The policies meant to protect society often harm the people who most need help.
