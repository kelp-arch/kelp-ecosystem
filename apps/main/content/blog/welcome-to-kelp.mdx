# Welcome to Kelp

We're excited to introduce **Kelp**, a comprehensive framework designed to support lasting transformation in addiction recovery.

## Our Mission

Kelp provides evidence-based structures that help individuals navigate the complex journey of recovery. By organizing knowledge across four key domains—Physiological, Psychological, Sociological, and Existential—we create clear pathways to understanding and growth.

## What Makes Kelp Different

Traditional recovery approaches often lack systematic organization. Kelp changes that by providing:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear organization from broad concepts to specific applications
- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in current research and clinical practice
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all dimensions of recovery

## Getting Started

Explore our framework, engage with the community, and discover how structured understanding can transform your recovery journey.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and refine the Kelp ecosystem.
